Our resident cat has now been forced to face the fact that he is not in fact a human being and is experiencing some existential dread as a result. 

We did the whole separate room scent swapping thing, peeks through the door/baby gate etc. Yesterday they met face to face &amp; today we let them spend more time together. There has been no attacking which is a HUGE relief! But our resident cat just growls at the new cat whenever she‚Äôs in eye line. Like long sustained growls. I feel terrible for the new cat who is just trying to play with a mouse toy, and worried for our resident cat that he is v stressed. When we separate them they both seem totally fine; there isn‚Äôt any ongoing stress once they‚Äôre apart from each other. 

I literally JUST ordered a Feliway &amp; I‚Äôm hoping that helps to mellow my resident cat a bit. Should we go back to peeks through the door?

1669608405,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi! I adopted a 3 year old cat 10 days ago(I know it‚Äôs not very long ago) and he‚Äôs been doing alright. Eating and drinking well, playing a little bit and exploring. However at the shelter they said he was very vocal and liked to be petted with chin scratches and behind the ears, but he won‚Äôt let me nor my parents even close to him. If we try and reach out he shys away and I‚Äôm scared this will become a problem for vet visits, maintaining his fur and checking him for ticks etc. during the summer. He doesn‚Äôt run away and hide but he seems very uncomfortable with hands in general. I‚Äôve been trying to work with him by first giving him a treat and walk to the other side of the room then proceeding to get closer every time he gets a treat to gain his trust. I‚Äôm at the point where he will most of the time eat it from my hand but backs off if I move my hand afterwards. When I do have a treat in my hand he will eat it and lick my hand for a while afterwards. He also sniffs our feet and sometimes hands but if I try and pretend to have a treat to get him close he won‚Äôt bat an eye and just stare at me. The first three days he only laid under our sofa but he‚Äôs been starting to lay in the sofa and around on the floor now but sometimes hides under the sofa again(which is totally fine as he probably like the fact that he gets space but still can be aware of where we are) He always follow us around and wants to be around us but at a distance.  I know I haven‚Äôt had him for long and that he‚Äôs probably still getting used to a new house and family but I worry that he won‚Äôt ever be more comfortable for his sake. We don‚Äôt know what he has been through but we know he was found on a landfill but he was already neutered but not chipped so someone either left him there or he was let outside too early and got lost. I‚Äôm just very stressed that I‚Äôm doing something wrong or it wasn‚Äôt a good fit comparing to the two previous cats I‚Äôve had. 

The other things is that for the past two days he‚Äôs beeen laying next to our balcony door or looking outside the window on the door meowing a lot as if he really wants to go outside but I dont want to let him outside before I know he‚Äôs fully comfortable and knows that this is his home and where to return and since it‚Äôs winter I was planning on just keeping him inside till spring because where I live it snows, freezing temps and there‚Äôs only two hours of daylight during winter time and if he were to get lost or trapped he wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance with this weather but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm torturing him by keeping him inside for so long.

1669606074,self.CatAdvice,True,"TL;DR: My nervous cat seems to be scared of me and hates me now because of the medicine I've been feeding her. Looking for insights as to how long it'll take for her to forgive me and perhaps some advice about how to give her medication so that it isn't as stressful for both of us. 

Some quick backstory: I adopted my three-year-old cat a little over a year ago, and it was a challenge at first. She was super shy and refused to go out of hiding for two months. I spent a lot of time and energy building up trust and now she's the most loving and annoying little cat ever. Fast forward to this past week, which has been a hectic one. I moved her back from my parents' house two weekends ago, where she had been staying for roughly six weeks while I was in and out of the city for work. Everything seemed okay, until I noticed her scooting twice and licking her butt and tail a lot, so I took her to the vet this past weekend. Since she absolutely loathes her carrier, these two experiences were not great for her.

The vet gave me some cream to rub on her butthole and some liquid Clavamox. Giving her the medication has proven to be a huge challenge, to the point where I can only really give her both medications once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed. She hides under the couch (and sometimes in the couch), refuses to eat even when there's no medicine mixed with her wet food or treats (thankfully still eating dry food), and is so much more stressed and nervous around me. She's only approached me twice today, and it's only the second day of having to give her medicine.

Normally, my cat forgives me for taking her to the vet or moving her around relatively quickly, usually within a few hours. The fact that she seems so scared of me now and is avoiding me breaks my heart, and it seems that all the work I put into getting her to trust me has been completely undone. I don't even know how I'll be able to continue for the rest of the week, which is the length of time the medicine has been prescribed for.

On the bright side, I suppose, I didn't notice her scooting at all the day before I took her to the vet and she was acting normally, and ever since the vet visit, she hasn't scooted, but I think that's because she's pretty much been in hiding since then.",CatAdvice,How long does it take a cat to forgive?

1669605894,self.CatAdvice,True,"Right now he is poorly (possible Giardia) but I've noticed for a while even before he was poorly he does these like involuntary muscle spasms. He seems to only do them lying down. And not all the time. he twitches in his sleep but I'm not worried about that. 

It's honestly small little like moments where he tenses then releases. I mean he's doing them right now while purring away. Other times he does it when he's laying on his own. Doesn't seem to matter what he's doing. They are minor movement his leg kinda moves a little, and I can see him generally tense a little but most seems to happen in the legs.

1669595986,self.CatAdvice,True,"I've been taking care of a young stray?/feral? cat for nearly 2 months, including one weekend when he got into my apartment and refused to leave for a while. After he finally went back out but tried to get back in again, I was hoping to adopt him but my landlord has said I can't have a pet indoors, then conceded that I could keep feeding it outside.  I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. 

I've got the cat booked for neutering soon, but no shelters will take him due to a combination of overcrowding and his lack of socialization. No vets will even look at him beyond neutering him (which sucks because he's got a weird spot that I want checked out, but that's a whole other problem). None of my friends who foster unsocialized cats can take him yet. I was advised by someone at one of the really good shelters nearby to keep working with him outside in hopes of getting him into adoptable condition by the time they have an opening for him. So the poor little guy is kind of stuck in this situation for now. 

Even though the landlord said I could keep an outdoor cat, recent changes he (the landlord) has made to the property have made the cat prefer to spend most of its time on the new neighbors' property. The landlord installed a panel over the crawlspace under our porch and we found fur stuck to it, suggesting that the cat had tried to squeeze through the panel. We built the cat an outdoor shelter, but it turns out the neighbors have a hole under their porch so the cat prefers it to the shelter. *Sometimes* the neighbors put food near the hole, so they know about him but I don't think they're friends with him the way I am. He also tears open their trash bags to forage through them and leaves a huge mess on their walkway, and he uses some old rubbish on that property as his personal gym. We had bushes that birds hung out in that the cat used to like to watch, but now the landlord has cut them down. The landlord has also put up a giant fence around half the property. 

The cat comes to me when called, usually crossing the neighbors' yard to do so, but now that it's cold, he doesn't want to hang out as much and goes back to the neighbors' house after his meals. I give him a pretty regular food supply, I've put catnip on his stuff here, and I got him one of those little microwavable cat shelter heaters, but after a few minutes he still prefers the safety and spaciousness of being under their porch. He used to show signs of feeling safe with me on our porch, but lately he has  become very jumpy and his socialization progress has regressed a little. 

I'm really worried that the new neighbors are going to get fed up with him. But since my landlord is adamant that the cat cannot be inside and since the cat can't access our crawlspace anymore, I don't know what to do to get him to stay on this property.

I have a stray cat that frequently hangs out in my garden. I have put up several posters in the area to see if she belongs to anyone and have not received anything back so far. For the past 3 weeks, I have been feeding her and she has been sleeping in my garden. I bought her a cat bed and she seems to enjoy the space. The problem I am having is she is incredibly skittish- she will not let me approach her to pet her or even just stand next to her. I worry as it is cold outside and I really want to check if she is ok and take her to a vet to see if she has been microchipped etc. I don't own any pets and am wondering if there is a way to get her to trust me. I have tried to bribe her with food, catnip, and toys but nothing seems to be working. Any ideas would be incredibly helpful. I want her to be able to trust me and if she does not have an owner I am looking to adopt.

1669554923,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 4 month old kitten yesterday, It was a hard decision but I thought it would help with my depression - and also because I miss my cat and rabbit from my parent‚Äôs home.
I brought him home by train and metro.
He was very quiet for 30 minutes and the next half hour he started meowing on the train. Tears came to my eyes, he was staring at me with his beautiful big eyes while meowing. He will miss his family (and his brother).

Once at home I locked myself in the bathroom with him, I put a pillow under the radiator, and gave him something to eat and drink. I spent two hours sitting on the floor with him, petting him, letting him explore and watching him sleep. Then I let him discover the kitchen and the main room.
He ended up eating, drinking and doing his business in his litter box. When I went to bed he came to snuggle with me, then he stuck to my face. I turned my back and he went to sleep on the sofa.

Everything is going well, only I feel bad. I have no appetite, my nose and throat are a little blocked (I had a cat and a rabbit at my parents' house for 18 years and never had any allergies). I am sensitive to the smell of cat drool when he plays, try to lick my nose. And also he leaves small deposits of fecal matter where he sits (sofa, cat tree, my sheets) probably microscopic but I can smell it. This kitten is clean though.

So here I am with all these feelings. 

He seems quite happy in my apartment, he purrs a lot and asks to play and cuddle. 
I'm afraid to leave him alone during the day for 9 hours, I'm afraid he'll do something bad / get bored.
For the moment I have only one toy, a thing with feathers, but I am afraid that he will ingest it by chewing on it.

We have an 8 year old female cat we adopted over a year ago.
The resident cat‚Äôs background/personality:
She was sent to the rescue after her last owner passed. Due to her previous experience with multiple owners and fosters, it takes her a while to warm up to people and she gets scared easily. But once she trusts a person, she turns into such a lovely cat.

And then there is a 1 year old female cat we recently adopted. 
The new cat‚Äôs background/personality:
She was a stray cat and was rescued with her little kittens 2-3 months before we adopted her.
She loves attention and food. She constantly purrs, meows, kneads and rubs her face against anyone‚Äôs hand. She seemed to be okay around other cats when we went to the rescue centre to see her.


It has been 6 weeks since we brought the new cat home, and they HATE each other.
Here is what‚Äôs been going on. (Sorry this is a lot of details)

- When we brought the new cat home, we had our office room ready for her with a litter box, food bowl, cat bed, cat tree, etc. We didn‚Äôt let them see each other but let them smell each other through the door. We fed them together (with the door closed) so they can associate food to each other‚Äôs smell. The resident cat was quite anxious and hissing a lot. She wasn‚Äôt even comfortable passing that door. But over time, she has gotten better and now she can tolerate eating 2 feet away from the door. (But she still hisses and runs off after finishing her food.)

- We have been keeping the new cat in the office room, and the resident cat in the bedroom. They take turns to explore around the house throughout the day. We usually sleep with the resident cat, but I have been sleeping with the new cat in the office room because she meows so much.


- On our week 2, they ran into each other. (My partner just open the office room to see the new cat, and she just ran downstairs to the kitchen) There was no hissing or any interactions other than eye-contact. (But there was a bit of screaming from their humans‚Ä¶)

- On our week 3,  they ran into each other again. (My partner just opened the bedroom door without knowing the new cat was right behind him) And the new cat just straight up attacked the resident cat who was sleeping next to me. The resident cat was absolutely terrified. There was chunks of hair in the new cat‚Äôs paws :(

- We let them see each other through a babygate. My partner was on the resident cat‚Äôs side and I was on the new cat‚Äôs side. The resident cat was 10 feet away from the babygate, hiding under a chair. After a few stares, the new cat attempted to climb the babygate. There were some hissing and howling. We ended the session after that.

- We also got a huge playpen(tent) and installed it in the living room. At first we tried keeping the new cat in the tent all day and let the resident cat approach her when she feels comfortable. For the first 2 days, the resident cat didn‚Äôt even come downstairs. On the third day, she came downstairs but when she came closer to the tent, the new cat tried to attack her.


And now we are on week 7. We‚Äôve watched a lot of youtube videos and read many articles, tried calming treats and all different types of Feliway plugins as well. I am so lost and beginning to wonder if it‚Äôs time for me to give up. I feel like I‚Äôm just torturing the cats and ourselves.

Now, he came with a blanket and bunch of toys from his old house, whenever I take out his old toys and he plays with it by himself he wouldn't stop meowing for a long time.

I need some advice &amp; was hoping to maybe get some feedback before Monday for the sake of my nerves. 

I have a 9 year old cat (Baylor) &amp; he recently came down with a super nasty cough, so I took him to the vet. It was an absolute nightmare &amp; he screamed/relieved himself the entire time he was in the back getting treated. I think (no, I know) he traumatized a beagle named Ralphie as well as 2 other cats &amp; a rabbit. The pigeons resting on the power lines outside probably sought out therapy because of what they heard. It was awful‚Ä¶ anyways‚Ä¶ 
He was also due for his yearly vaccines, so the vet decided to administer his antibiotics/steroids/vaccines all at once. The alternative was to put him through a 2nd trip &amp; sedate him, but he thought that would be more traumatic than just doing it all at once, so that‚Äôs what we did. That‚Äôs been 10 days ago exactly, &amp; his vet said the antibiotics would stay in his system for 2 weeks (if that‚Äôs relevant). 

Post-vet trip, he definitely didn‚Äôt feel well, but that was expected &amp; within 2 days his cough was gone &amp; he‚Äôd perked back up. While he was still recovering though, he stayed pretty much under our bed the entire time with the exception to eat &amp; potty. It‚Äôs worth noting (I think) that we recently moved in July &amp; our bedroom has carpet, which is something he‚Äôs never laid on before. I only mention that because I feel like it‚Äôs possible that the reason he is still staying under the bed is because it‚Äôs a new hiding spot he discovered that made him feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù while he was feeling sick and plus it‚Äôs warm (I‚Äôm in KY so winter is settling in). 

But that‚Äôs what I need advice on - he‚Äôs still under the bed &amp; comes out pretty much never. For a few days he was out &amp; about more often than he is now. Idk. 
He‚Äôll come downstairs &amp; meow for treats, but right back upstairs he goes straight under the bed. 
I have noticed that while he‚Äôs still using the litter box, there are a couple drops of pee (likes he‚Äôs dribbled) outside the box; however, we have another cat &amp; he‚Äôs a hot mess - he‚Äôs the messiest litter box user in all the land, so idk that it isn‚Äôt him. 

Anyways, he acts 100% normal, he looks normal in the eyes, when I check on him he‚Äôs responsive &amp; seems coherent, he just seems to have no desire to leave his little nest under the bed. 
Which, I have no issues with him being under there, so long as he‚Äôs okay. 

I‚Äôm calling his vet Monday, but was hopeful for some feedback before then. 
I hate to put him back through it because he‚Äôll have to be sedated before they‚Äôll work with him, especially if it‚Äôs unnecessary. Jeeze.

Best case scenario would be that they neighbor will keep their dog inside so she can roam around. But I think its most likely that we should keep her as a completely indoor cat.

Wisp is a very active kitty who loves hunting and fighting and biting, she definitely has her snuggly moments and loves us and her sister but has sooo much energy. It's proving difficult to keep her focused on toys for longer periods of time, once she gets bored of playing with a toy and we stop, she immediately starts to attack stuff in the house. 

The blinds are a big issue accelerating our need for toys because she is systemically destroying them. Every window blind has pieces missing and we're increasingly afraid that our landlord will take notice of it if she continues. Keeping them rolled up isn't feasible as we're visible for anyone coming in the apartment building due to our apt placement. Curtains are against the lease terms unfortunately too.

Getting her redirected to toys is just getting harder with time. If anyone can suggest toys that might scratch this itch for her please let me know!! Anything work for your cats? Got any ideas that might fit what she needs? I'm running low on ideas. Details on what we've learned so far:

What she seems to enjoy is being able to reach/jump up and hunt things above her. The blinds are heavenly, she also climbed and ripped apart a small potted tree. Climbing it and hunting the leaves as they shook in response to her climbing was irresistible. She got bored when the leaves were all ripped off and the thin trunk was bent sideways so climbing wasn't very good.

I have a tall tower scratcher, medium height cat tree with 3 tallish levels, and a dangling bungee toy attached to a doorway arch. They just can't compete with the sweet sweet blinds. Other toys she likes but can't focus on anymore are the little plastic springs to hunt, and feather/ribbon bird on a wand.

1669447779,self.CatAdvice,True,"Alright, well like the title says, my 4 y/o cat has developed a habit of sticking/dipping/spooning out her food with her paws. 

She‚Äôs always been a bit quirky, and I discovered quickly after I adopted her at 3 months, that if I gave her wet food without mashing it up completely with water into a thinner paste/soup, that she would just grab chunks and pull them on the floor. She also ate her dry food so fast that I had to buy her a slow feeder.

She‚Äôs done well with adjustments I made according to her weird habits  and I haven‚Äôt really had issues until a few months ago when I noticed she was using her paws to scoop out her wet food and either lick it off her paws, or eat it off the ground.

I thought maybe the dish we had was too deep and narrow and it was hurting her whiskers to use that bowl, so I bought bowls that are flat and wide. Unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt helped and I‚Äôm running out of ideas. I‚Äôve even put down a mat to help curb messes.

I‚Äôm now thinking that maybe I should get an elevated pet bowl to see if it‚Äôs more to do with the discomfort of eating from a bowl on the floor.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has dealt with this sort of problem before and what things were tried and what worked.

I‚Äôm just worried because she‚Äôll jump straight from her litter and then use her paws to eat. I can‚Äôt imagine that‚Äôs good for her :( not to mention I obviously don‚Äôt want my cat eating straight off the floor. Sometimes I step in food without realizing and she‚Äôll just eat that too.

One other weird food bowl issue I‚Äôve also noticed recently is that she sometimes gets in this obsessive mindset of trying to bury her food. Of course she cannot dig into my floor, she she ends up scratching around her bowl until sometimes she tips it over. I have her food dish as far from her litterbox as I can have it, because I‚Äôve read that sometimes cat‚Äôs will want to bury their scent and of course a kill/eating area is something cats would want to coverup from predators or other cats.

After a few months, when I noticed she was waking me up to demand her food, I stopped doing that, and gave her food each evening instead. 

The problem is, she never unlearned this habit, and since then wake me up nearly each morning at 4-6 am. 
She is very demanding, purring, licking, climbing me, and above all, the dreadfully ""paw in the eye"" maneuver!
She is relentless, until I'm up and about, then she will go eat without further problem and let me go back to sleep (if I manage to...)

Some details:

She have a tower feeder.  Each evening I put enough kibble for 24h. So she have far enough kibble in the tower for her morning meal. 

She know how to feed herself from the tower, and doesn't need me. She just wait until I'm up and in the same room as the feeder to do it... I don't even have to approach the feeder, just being in the same room... 

To be more precise, there is a stair leading to the main room. 
If I am on the last step of the stair, she will wait, keep peace between the feeder and me, prodding me to continue. 
If I make one more step to be in the room, she will be content and eat, I'm not needed anymore..

1669431317,self.CatAdvice,True,"TL/DR: my cat is being extremely aggressive with me and I need tips to navigate it until the vet. 

I am prefacing this by making it clear she‚Äôs going to be checked out by the vet in a few days (which was the soonest they could fit her in) 

Background info: 
My cat has always been aggressive when I have visitors, but it‚Äôs been manageable. 

Recently she‚Äôs been aggressive with me - this has been only following a specific incident. 

I blew a hiking safety whistle in the kitchen (just not thinking) and it triggered an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù where she started yowling at me, pupils dilated, and aggressively following me as I backed away from her until I could cordon her into a part of the house to calm down. (I had some gabepenton gave to her in food to help the calm) 

Since then there‚Äôs been multiple occasions where she though I was going to do that loud noise thing in the kitchen, and has began to do the same behaviours. 

The last two days in particular have been hellish because she mistook my being at the bench in the kitchen as a possible re-do, I caught her eye and noticed her pupils dilating and beginning to take the strange body language she displayed that night, and has been aggressive ever since. 

I thought the night would ‚Äúreset‚Äù her to calm mode, but this morning she was on edge and not really comfortable as I moved about my morning duties, tentative and anxious, sharply observing me - I fed her and played for a while with her toy but noticed whenever I caught her eye her focus would be primarily on me and not the toy and I sensed it wouldn‚Äôt take much at all to set her off again. Cut to me making a tea in the kitchen, and she was at my feet, when I looked down and at her, the pupils went big again and she began her tense body and meowing, and as soon as I back away she yowls louder and it‚Äôs happening once again. 

I feel so guilty because she‚Äôs spend most of the last 36 hours or so blocked off in a small part of the house. I‚Äôm giving her the gabepenten in food serves to try and calm some of this - but I just feel awful, it‚Äôs a silly mistake I made one time, thats turned into what appears to be a trauma for her - as she already had a nervous disposition. Now our relationship has been severely impacted, the trust seems gone. I always appreciated that she was a cranky little defensive thing, but with me she was tolerant, and even sometimes, when I was lucky, loving and a lap cat etc. 

I‚Äôm terribly afraid of what‚Äôs going to happen at the vets - because the last few times I‚Äôve brought her in, it‚Äôs basically been a costly bust, because they‚Äôre not willing to take her out of her cage (understandably) even with the gabepenton, so they‚Äôve not been able to perform a full check. 

This time they say they‚Äôll sedate her and check her ears because she‚Äôs been shaking her head frequently and seems bothered by her ears. (This also makes me feel awful because what if the whistle caused some damage!?) 

Anyways - now all the background has been provided - my question is - how do I make it through the next 3 days if her temperament remains on this level? Am I going to have to keep drugging her and sequestering her in small rooms until then, for my own safety? Isn‚Äôt that only going to cause her further trauma and distrust?

I have Gus and another boy, and they get along, they've started playing and everything, they also eat dinner side by side everyday. My roommate has two cats as well. 



Gus is a larger guy compared to two and the one he doesn't suddenly get along with (Soup) is definitely the biggest. Gus would still be on edge for a while while walking by Soup and would hiss and maybe swat if Soup got too close but that was it. 


Yesterday all of a sudden a cat fight broke out between the two while I was out of the house. My roommate described it to be pretty scary, and both of them were going toward one another... so we decided to keep Gus isolated in my room for the night, and just today I decided to let Gus out to see how it would go... and yes, the two went to fight again. I initially grabbed gus who was trying to get out of my arms and run away while Soup was climbing up me to attack. I then grabbed Soup who mauled up my arm while Gus ran away.

I have seen kitten play dates are a bad idea on here, I‚Äôm worried about the potential of her getting used to the new house then after this month moving back here to our house where her space would be reduced to one floor instead of three.

The plot also gets even more complicated when one of the cats I‚Äôm taking care of over there is one my neighbor is contemplating rehoming to me when I move out within the next year.

I have a dilemma on a potential foster fail situation and I‚Äôd like to get some perspective. 


I‚Äôve been fostering for about a year and a half and have fostered 20 cats. Very early in our foster days, my partner and I adopted a brother and sister from a litter we were fostering. We wanted to keep the girl immediately and we kept her brother because he was nervous and needed a pal. We love them unconditionally and have no regrets whatsoever. My partner and I acknowledge we were overzealous at the time and probably should‚Äôve given them a chance to get adopted out. Fast forward, and we have significantly more fostering experience after 20 kittens. I love my fosters, but I‚Äôve never been that attached to them and am happy when they find their homes. 

Until we got our current fosters last weekend, Truffles and Butterscotch, a bonded pair of calico sisters. My heart exploded the moment I let them out of their carrier. They‚Äôre 6 months old, my oldest fosters so far. They are so loving, polite, cuddly, get along with my cats, and well mannered girls. They wanted to sleep under the covers with us immediately and be carried around like babies. My partner and I are *so* torn on keeping them. We fully acknowledge 4 cats is a lot of work, cleaning, more vet bills and more commitment. But we adore them in a way I haven‚Äôt felt about any of my previous fosters, including my own cats. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE my cats. But it took me a while to feel that level of connection with them. Both my partner and I feel highly emotional at the thought of them leaving our house, and neither of us have felt that before.

My partner and I have two beautiful cats (7yo Persian/Ragdoll male and 3yo Persian female). We recently adopted a British Shorthair kitten (3.5 months-ish male) and he is very excited and active, as kittens are..

The 7yo is fine with him but sometimes loses his patience. The 3yo, however, is very stressed by the kitten. She hasn't been nice to him once. She hisses and growls at him if she sees him nearby and bats him if he dares to get too close. I know this stuff is normal, but he's been home over a month with no improvement.

This evening I was trying to remove some of her matted fur and she got very aggressive with me. She also seems to have some balding spots on the side of her belly (possibly over grooming, or maybe from matting?) she often gets matts but it's never been this alarming. She's also losing her voice from hissing so much.

We have feliway friends plugins but they don't seem to be helping. I absolutely adore my little Persian, she's always been feisty and a little distant, but now she seems VERY stressed and aggressive with everyone, not just the kitten.

The kitten has a special room he's been confined to since he came home so they have their own 'safe spaces' but I'm worried my little Persian is going to end up in a bad way from the stress.

They always slept together and never seemed to mind sharing their resources (we have plenty of food and water resources around the house and 3 litterboxes). They are both neutered. 

Four days ago they suddenly got into a nasty fight. They were both sleeping in our bed and out of the blue we started hearing yeowling and hissing. The smaller one hid and there were drops of urine and bits of fur on the floor. After this I separated them, and kept them in different rooms, each with water, food and litterboxes. 

One day later I tried to unite them again. They were fine for 20 minutes, and then started fighting again. 

Now I've been keeping them separated for 3 days. They are chill with me and my partner, they just dont like being stuck in rooms, without being able to roam around the house. One of the rooms has a glass door, so I can have them both looking at eachother without touching - however, I have been doing this for short periods of time since when they see eachother they freak out and stare, with raised hairs. Both seem agressive towards one another. 

Last time I did this (today), the smaller one hid, and has been hiding inside the glass door room ever since.

2nd option: a room in the house of a friend. This friend has another cat and 2 dogs.

Does anyone have any suggestions - I am feeling a bit like we made a mistake not getting either *just* the 2.5 yr old or not getting the 7mo along with another kitten from his litter. 

He is very active and curious. He wants to play anytime he isn‚Äôt sleeping. She enjoys laying low all day long and can sit in front of the window for hours on end. She isn‚Äôt really interested in play time (maybe about 10 min max (if that) a day). Obviously this isn‚Äôt the best mix. He walks around sadly meowing sometimes like he really wants a friend. I work from home so I can give him a bit of attention but I really feel like he needs a friend around his age with similar energy. 

We cannot get a third cat at our apartment (2 max). Also, we don‚Äôt know her history - the shelter didn‚Äôt have much info to share. (Don‚Äôt know if she was someone‚Äôs house pet that they gave up or what). He and his liter were found in a trash can and spent the first 6 months at the shelter. 

At first she was very scared of him. Hissing and running and hiding anytime he got near. (We had them meet at the shelter and that didn‚Äôt happen there). Over the course of the last month that has improved and it isn‚Äôt as often. However he tries to play with her and it truly seems like she just doesn‚Äôt understand what play is. We thought they were finally playing together the other day but once the wrestling stopped it was clear she did not know that it was play (she was extremely shaken and anxious for ~20 min after).

She has two litter boxes in different parts of the house that are always accessible to her and they're scooped daily. I switch out the litter every 4-6 weeks. She has a soft litter (okocat) for her paws and I put Cat Attract in it when I swap out the boxes.

We've swapped out her food for one that suits her, gone through three or four litters, got a hood for both of her boxes, took off a hood, bought a new box, put it in another location, we encourage her and give her extra affection every time we see her use the litter box, and we move her into the litter box if she looks like she's about to go.

We took her to the vet months ago, but the vet told us that she was perfectly healthy, just having behavioral problems, but to keep trying new things. 

It's incredibly stressful and honestly embarrassing especially that it's gone on this long, and I absolutely would never rehome her unless I literally could not take care of her anymore financially and/or physically but I'm running out of solutions.

1669323690,self.CatAdvice,True,"Our two cats are 1,5y, f and m. My girl always voiced her disapproval by peeing, but very rarely (maybe 3 times since we got them a year ago) and it was always very clear what the reason was (she peed on clothes that smelled like a different cat that lay on the floor for some time for example). 

So roughly two weeks ago, she suddenly started peeing into the corridor and the bathroom in three different spots. We went to the vet, medically she is fine. I'm trying to figure out what the problem is, but I'm struggling here, so maybe someone has some ideas. 

So what I've already figured out/ruled out: 

Changes: My schedule changed and I'm home a bit less. My SO is home the same amount of time as before, and the cats schedule didn't change (same feeding and play times). Also, I disconnected their water fountain and switched it temporarily to a simple bowl (because the cats didn't use it and I was planning on trying a different one. Extra problem, the water pump started to be super loud and annoying after a year). But could that really be why she pees outside the box? Two to three times a day? And if so, what can I do to stop it?

What I'm already doing right: the two cats have three litter boxes that get cleaned two to three times a day. They don't have a lid or lining and are placed both in social and a bit more quiet areas throughout the house (living room, bathroom and by the entrance), also no litter changes. The pee spots get cleaned with enzyme cleaners every time after the cat pees there. We play with wand toys three times a day for ~15-20 mins each, we have regular feeding times. The cats have toys they can play play themselves, cat trees, window spots, and get lots of attention and love. There is no tension between the cats, they play with each other and all seems fine. We had a feliway diffuser before when we they came to us but stopped using it shortly after, we bought a new one two days ago, but it didn't change anything yet.

Short story long, I've adopted 2 kittens - they are 14 weeks old now. They are very kind, playful, and cute. They sleep the entire day but they have this thing where they get crazy active around 1-2 AM.

They look like ""posseted"" creatures. They hit everything, jump from all over the place and run like crazy. Initially I thought I can get them tired, but they can keep at it over 1 hour...  They mostly chase each other, but even if just one of them feels like this, he's doing it all by himself. And it's terrible for my neighbours.

Currently, what I do is when they get active, I close them in the smallest room - the bathroom. They miau for 5 minutes, hit the door... but eventually they go to sleep. However, I feel bad to do this.

I've tried feeding them earlier (last meal at 19-20). I tried feeding them late (last meal at 23). I tried playing with them for over 1h with all sorts of toys - around 9PM. It's great, at 10 they go to sleep, wake up an 2AM and go crazy again.

I tried keeping them awake during the day, but... I still have to work. Every time I stop giving them attention, they just go to sleep.   


Usually I try to hit the bed around 11 - where I stay 1h longer reading. Sometimes they come sleep with me, sometimes they don't...

Note: They also have a small window of crazy activity in the morning, around 8. But it ends after I feed them (usually at 8:30) - they just go to sleep after.

I went back to the shop, and well turns out, the shop does in fact state that they do mix the cat litter with bentonite clay. 89% is Tofu Cat Litter and 11% is Bentonite (or so the product says). I simply just didn't pay attention, since I was more focused on searching for the same brand I liked.

Today he is eating a little still. Is much more himself, alert, playful, wants fuss. Even had 100 percent chicken breast treats. But he's been 3 times today. 2 times like soft serve but a little more put together. Then this evening so almost the 4th day now it was slightly yellow again, some formation but more liquid then earlier today. 

I'm not sure wether he's actually on the mend or I should take him up tomorrow. In himself he's doing better but the slightly worse last poo worries me.

Everytime he goes to the vet and for the whole journey he meows, shakes and pants. Then comes home and shakes for hours. 

Also money is a issue. I do have a little and I do have insurance but it's the kind you pay upfront and claim back. I can attach photos of poop but I'm not sure you'd want to see.

I‚Äôve been taking care of them with the hope of socializing them and giving them out for adoption. Their socialization process has been slow. I want to know when the right time to let them out into my bedroom is, their enclosure is in my bedroom. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è(Female) Kitten 1 
Arrived October 25-
I started to let her out into the room 2 weeks ago but now I only let her out to sleep on the bed. When let out in my room, very playful and active on her own but gets scared easily and runs and hides when I walk into the room, when there‚Äôs sounds or sometimes if I move. Sometimes she‚Äôll let me pet her but most of the time she won‚Äôt stay and will run off. Seems antsy to be loose in the room. Used to be cuddlier when she arrived. The one with the most progress, lets me pick her up most of the time when in the enclosure, sleeps on my bed but not very cuddly.  

‚ñ™Ô∏è(Male) Kitten 2 
Arrived November 7- 
Has bitten me hard 3 times, they day he arrived and the day after a vet visit. This kitten has had the slowest progress of all three. He‚Äôll stay on my lap to eat but will want off as soon as he‚Äôs done eating. I pet him when he eats. Usually doesn‚Äôt let me pet him when I reach in the enclosure. Does eat from my hand. Strong, if he runs I have to let him go, he‚Äôll bite, wiggle and scratch otherwise. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è(Female?) Kitten 3
Arrived November 15-I can pet her sometimes while she‚Äôs in the enclosure. Sometimes she watches me intently and up until recently, her eyes dilated most of the time I was near, not as much now, I look away. She‚Äôll stay on my lap a little while after feeding and I‚Äôll pet her. Will eat from my hand. 

‚ûñThey all seem to want to be out in the room and get really curious when kitten 1 is out but since I don‚Äôt know when the right time to introduce them to my bedroom is, I stopped letting Kitten 1 out.

About half the time he‚Äôll jump on the bed to bring us the toy and once we say hi to him, he just lays down like normal. This happens occasionally (about every few days) during the day as well. It‚Äôs not a problem but I have also noticed that when he does this, he‚Äôll sometimes make a motion kind of like he‚Äôs trying to cough up a hairball but doesn‚Äôt make any sound and doesn‚Äôt drop the toy when he does this.

So my cat Blue is a very well behaved boy and I trained him to go to the toilet outside when he was little with no problems.

I moved house in August and kept him in for 6 weeks with his litter tray. When he started going outside, I got a cat flap fitted and naturally he started finding an outside loo and I took the litter tray away. 

There are some new big bully cats he‚Äôs had a few stand offs with and now he‚Äôs a bit afraid of going outside, even nipping out to the toilet. He‚Äôll go if I‚Äôm out there with him, but I can‚Äôt always keep an eye on when he might need to go, and I‚Äôm not always in.

I started trying to associate the outside with ‚Äúgood things‚Äù so would give him his breakfast outside and sit with him, and have also been hiding treats around the patio which generally keeps him entertained. 

However in the last couple of weeks,  his go-to before he even thinks to go outside is finding corners in the house to go to the toilet. It‚Äôs very frustrating for obvious reasons, and this morning I have had to reinstate the litter tray because it‚Äôs become such a regular occurrence and I don‚Äôt trust him in the house anymore. It doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs very rainy where I live which is an extra reason he doesn‚Äôt always want to go outside.

1669165133,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I have three cats and I just moved out of my parents house for the first time into a spacious two bedroom apartment by myself. My oldest cat I've had for five years, then there's the ""outside cat"" I took with me who is three years old. Then I have a young one who is only a year and a half. My young one is the kitten of the ""outside cat"" and has been indoors since she was old enough to be separated as I somehow convinced my parents to let her in.

So, the problem is I moved to a new place four days ago and my youngest cat went into shock mode. She stopped eating and was hiding which is very unlike her. She's an energetically playful cat and very, very food motivated so it's depressing to see her like this. She's slowly coming around but her playful energy hasn't been restored and I'm fearful she might be lonely during the day while I'm at work. My apartment is also in a big complex so there are little noises here and there too that she seems to be sensitive to; my parents live in a rural country home with no background noise.

She loves the other two cats, but I think she misses my parents more than anything. My dad gave her a lot of attention and he's retired, so he was home with her all day. Both my parents are not cat people but they love her and practically begged me to let them keep her. Now that she's with me, I'm having doubts on whether or not it's right for me to have her. She doesn't seem like herself and I know she'd probably be happier in her old home with somebody who will be with her all day. But then again, I've had her since she was born and I also love her a lot and would miss her.

Would it be better to bring her back to my parents or keep her? I've been an emotional wreck and so conflicted over this because I don't want to give her up but I want what's best for her. I really want more opinions to help me come to a concrete decision; I know cats are sensitive to change so if I choose to bring her back, I would want to do it soon so that I don't further traumatize her.

My partner, and I recently took in a 6yr old cat(D) from a rehoming situation. We already had our current 7yr old cat(R). R suffers from feline herpes, and has always been on a grain free diet to help with those symptoms(whether it does or not is another question in itself, feel free to voice your thoughts.) D suffers from urinary issues, and came to us with urinary care dry food that he never seemed to avoid, and ate R's dry food. We have since switched him to R's dry food, and put him on Authority Urinary Care wet food for this reason. R's wet food is Purina Beyond grain free, and the current dry is Purina One True Instinct grain free.

We are looking to switch their foods to something to possibly help with weight loss for R, as he is overweight. We don't have any concerns with D's issues, and wouldn't consider him overweight by any means but he definitely could make his way to being a chonker very easily. An option we have found is Authority Hairball Control + Weight Management dry food. They also make a wet Healthy Weight food.

My question I guess is... are we better to switch R's wet food to the Healthy Weight stuff, and leave them both on current dry food... Switch R over to the Authority wet/dry weight food, but also give D the new dry food!? OR just switch the dry food for both, and leave R on his current wet food.

I fell in love with this black cat and she was the longest resident. She was around a year old and so sweet and crazy. She‚Äôs so active and loves climbing and playing and talking lol. Anyway, she‚Äôs around 3 years old now and still is so active so I thought we could get another cat. We tried to get a male cat around a year ago and it went after her a few times and stressed her out so we got rid of it. She always grew up with cats and came into the shelter with two other cats. My friend stayed and brought her cats over and my cat was fine. So we thought a female kitten would be perfect. 

I found one and brought it home last night from a friend who found her in a storm drain. She‚Äôs been to the vet but still needs fixed. My cat is FREAKING OUT. this kitten is skkkk tiny and probably only around 8/9 weeks old and SO SWEET. my cats hair immediately went up and she started hissing and growing. Never seen her act like that. Have the kitten in the bathroom with litter food bed and toys and my cat is walking slow and low and hiding and freaked out. Will this get better? Did I make a mistake?

**Tl;dr** is -- has anyone tried switching from **Hill's Prescription diet i/d Digestive Care to Purina Pro-Plan EN Gastoenteric? Canned wet food only.** Purina is $67 for 24 cans online whereas my vet office charges $109 for 24 cans of Hill's Prescription.

1669139109,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello all, I currently am the mom to 3 wonderful cats! I will be referring to them by number they were adopted so number 1 is the oldest and 3 is the youngest! 

Number 1 came home as a 3.5 month old kitten almost two years ago. When we brought home number 2 a few months later, it was like soulmates meeting for the first time! They loved each other immediately and have been inseparable ever since so I thought a new kitten wouldn‚Äôt be much of an issue.

Fast forward to now and I‚Äôve completely fallen in love with a new kitten and have brought him home. We did the slow introduction, scent swapping, feeding together, and playing together (only positive experiences). There were green flags the whole way through. Not a single hiss or swat. Number 1 was playing with the new baby and zooming around like a kitten again. Now I thought they must be ready to sleep all together last night but number one went completely Mr. Hyde, hissing and swatting like he‚Äôd never seen this cat before! (Mind you they were snuggling on the couch just an hour before). He even swatted at number 2, something he normally would never do.

I have a strong inkling he‚Äôs possessive of our bed, or maybe he‚Äôs possessive of snuggling with me? He‚Äôs normally the cuddler and number 2 lays by my feet so there‚Äôs never been a rift before. Last night he was being insufferable so I put him in our guest room to sleep. And now this morning, him and number 3 are all good once again! 

I guess my big question is what can I do to benefit all parties? I don‚Äôt want to sleep without the baby because I don‚Äôt want him being alone, and I don‚Äôt want to encourage inappropriate urination for number 1 because I‚Äôm alienating him.

We followed the slow introduction advice as best we could. However we have hit an impasse with aggressive chasing. The tabby has always been a bit aggressive with chasing and stalking behaviours.

They've never actually fought outright, but light swatting and growling is common at the end of a chase...

The thing is they can go a day or more getting along and then just start. We have a camera up to record and cannot find a trigger, although the stairs in the house seem to be the area where conflict usually starts.

We are not sure if these are play attempts, something we need to let happen on occasion so they can sort hierarchy, or what to do. FWIW we did just leave it for a weekend and while it did keep happening it didn't escalate.

Note: they are separated at all times if we cannot be there to watch them.

As a side note to this we are really struggling with rewards for the Maine Coon. She has no interest in any sort of cat treats but will absolutely try her luck at stealing chocolate and sweets if they are not watched, so any advice for appropriate sweet treats would be great.

So just like the title says my indoor car has started to turn into a big furry ball. She is 1.5 years and a pretty small cat , should weight about 3.5 to be healthy. She has always been thin and been able to have food freely. These last 2 months I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs starting to put on some weight and weighs about 4 kg now from weighing 3,5 for her whole adult life and still growing.

I‚Äôm having a bit of a hard time deciding how to deal with her feeding because I don‚Äôt want her to go hungry several hours a day or night. What I‚Äôve started doing is giving her more wet food since it contains less calories and then she has her dry food to snack on during the day/night. The feeding instructions says that she needs 0.5 dl a day , and that‚Äôs without wet food, which I feel is a very small amount of food to feel full on 24h a day, especially when she eats it really fast and then have nothing. I have an activation feeder and a bowl and she always get some in her bowl and a free amount of food in the feeder since she only eats a small amount from it from time to time. And no, I can‚Äôt afford feeding her only wet food at this time but will do it when I‚Äôm finished with my studies and have a good income.

So my question is , should I stop giving her dry food in her bowl and only keep the activation feeder? I don‚Äôt know if she will eat enough then but since she seems to use it even when she has food in her bowl I think it would be a good option.

If else, what is I good feeding routine so that she won‚Äôt be without food for 8 hours at night or day. Right now I give her maybe 0.5-1 dl wet food every morning and evening and not sure how often or how much dry food I should give at what times.

Felix is very adaptable and easy-going; he's enjoyed socializing with my parents and exploring the house. He was very submissive and hesitant around Max when they met, and just kept his distance.

But to my surprise, Max was aggressive towards ME. Despite how they were only in the same room together for about 10 minutes (with no conflict), when I later tried to talk to/pet him, he growled, hissed, and even swatted at me. He hissed at my parents too when they tried, but he was significantly more aggressive towards me. 

It breaks my heart because he used to LOVE me, and I'm worried  that he might resent me now? We're keeping them separated; with Felix upstairs and Max downstairs (where he spends most of his time anyway.) Should we just not attempt to introduce them again and keep them separated?",CatAdvice,Can my cat coexist with my parent's cat over the holidays?,

1669057246,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello!

I have two cats, and recently started fostering a third cat. Our kitten, around 8mo, was rescued from a feral mother. She is very food motivated, which has historically made it super easy to train her to get used to things, but I am having trouble with how she interacts with the foster cat.

Half the time, she will completely ignore him - running past him to get into a room, or sharing a space with general disinterest. She is very treat motivated, and will nearly crawl \_under\_ the foster cat to get treats. She isn't defensive about it or anything, they just happily eat treats next to each other. She doesn't seem very smart.

However, our kitten will also chase him around the house, cornering him under tables, watching him like a hawk. She will hiss and sputter and take swings at him occasionally - it does not seem like play behavior and the foster cat definitely isn't reading it as such.

I'm not sure how to disincentivize her from picking fights. The foster cat is much bigger than her, I'm not worried about his safety that much, but he is also a sweet guy who clearly does not want to fight. He would much rather flee.

1669030573,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone,

I have a one year old cat who occasionally (once or twice a day) will pee outside of her litter box. She is spayed and according to her vet is healthy. She usually pees in front of doors, like the bathroom door if it is closed or my roommate's door or even the front door even though she does not like the outside. I've been trying to combat the issue by making sure to take her with me when I use the bathroom and my roommate is trying to do the same but recently I went on a trip and had to leave my cat with my roommate and the peeing got worse so now I'm looking for a long-term solution. 

The peeing started about a month after I adopted her (which would be march 2022). Around the same time she fell the bathtub while I was taking a bath. I don't know how significant of an incident it was but the peeing started around the same time. She isn't that squeemish of water nowadays so I don't think that is the reason for it. Also, my roommate moved in a little while after that. 

Here are the solutions I already tried:

1- Taking her with me to the bathroom and keeping doors open (which isn't always possible). 

2- Putting her in the litterbox after meals and after she sleeps. Works somewhat well, except for when I am at work or at night (so half of the time).

3- Changing litters. I use a clumping small pellet litter, which is what vets recommend for these kinds of issues. I scoop multiple times every day and change out the litter every month.

4- Changing her food. She gets wet food each morning and dry food throughout the day. Don't know what else I could do about that. 

She is overall a somewhat nervous cat. She will usually meow outside our doors whenever we close them and meow when we come back from the outside. I've also very briefly given Feliway (the spray version) a try and it seemed to work but I've read very mixed reviews and I wanted to ask here before committing to it. 

At this point I'm pretty desparate to solve this issue and would be open to any suggestions. If you have any questions or need more information, please ask. Thank you :)",CatAdvice,My cat will not stop peeing outside of the litter box,

Of course, these are all very normal but the weird thing is what's happening now. The mother cat gave birth to two new kittens this week. As normal, she's again being very caring and protective of the new kittens.

1668986734,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I rescued a little feral kitten, Basil, when she was 10wks old after she appeared my back deck. It has been about a month now and I've successfully been able to socialize her (although she still is a bit skittish) so now I'm starting the process of introducing her to my resident cat, Peaches.

Peaches is 5yrs old and my most beloved nightmare lol She I describe her as the poster child of ""single kitten syndrome"" and I have barely been able to improve her play aggression for the 4yrs I've had her ü•≤ She still has the energy of a kitten, and I was contemplating getting her a kitten next year to maybe reduce the violent attacks on my legs, but hey! That's when Basil showed up!

I'm following Jackson Galaxy's method of introducing cats, but these two have accidentally come face to face before-- when I first trapped the kitten and was clearing a bathroom, I accidentally didn't shut the door right and they briefly sniffed each other's noses before I shooed Peaches away. Note that this is a shockingly good cat interaction for Peaches bc if she faces a cat outdoors through a window she typically screams like she's dying. The 2nd time they interacted was again, bc I'm terrible at shutting doors. I entered my office (where kitten is kept) to find Peaches staring intensely at the kitten like she was shocked that this creature was still here lol This time Peaches did hiss when she was picked up, but I think that's more because she was startled üòÖ

Now, this is where I am getting mixed signals. Room swapping? Not a problem; Peaches sniffed around at first but then just carried on with life. And it's the same thing with feeding on either side of the door! Peaches has no qualms with eating her food with Basil's bowl right up near her-- Peaches actually eats faster than the kitten, and when she's done eating she just walks away as usual! BUT the kitten recently discovered that she can fit her little paws underneath the door, and if Peaches sees her little paw, it's an immediate big hiss üò≠? Idk how she can be okay with all the other steps day one, but a little paw and it's game over??

I feel bad for the kitten, bc she really wants to play with Peaches and will try to door-dash if she notices Peaches (Peaches does not notice her bc she is busy begging for the food I bring the kitten lol). Do I move on to the next step of eating with only a screen (or in this case, through the mesh of Basil's giant play pen) or is this a sign that things are going sour?

I'm super worried bc I'll be visiting my parents in a month and Peaches comes with me for that, but this time kitten will have to come with me too! I was so hoping Peaches would be more accepting of a baby cat but alas she still hates poor lil Basil üò¢

1668984517,self.CatAdvice,True,"For some background: my 1.5 year old male tabby, Ivy, has been with me since I adopted him as a 9 week old kitten. He was the only kitten in the RSPCA enclosure who didn't run when he saw my 43 kg (95 lb) dog Isaac approach, and they were best friends within 10 minutes at home. Ivy goes right up to people when they visit, whether strangers or otherwise, loves pats from everyone. Goes for harnessed walks, even hangs out the car window on trips (harnessed to belt buckle, I promise). So he's a dog cat really. Adventurous, affectionate, smart, curious.

At home, it's been just Ivy and Isaac (who cuddle together all the time and play together occassionally), plus a house rabbit (Ivy would sometimes bully her during play but otherwise they left each other alone), who has since passed of old age. Ivy is an indoor cat but he's allowed access to a cat enclosure thing that allows him to go right to the fence. There, he calls SUPER loudly to the neighbour's cat to play and can often get quite upset when she doesn't show up.

His only semi extended interaction with a cat was when I recently took care of my friend's 1 year old shy female cat named Nyx for a week. Ivy was always very curious, patient, desperate to play but gave Nyx her space. They never quite got to cuddle levels because Nyx was very standoffish, but Ivy came close to winning her over. And Ivy was utterly heartbroken when the week was over and Nyx went back home. He wandered around the apartment looking dejected for a whole day. And he still goes to the fence daily for some cat interaction, which he doesn't always get.

My question is whether these are all signs that I should adopt another cat. I've read a lot of articles and posts warning about the difficulties, but in those cases, it seemed to be with a cat who was being introduced to another cat for the first time. So I was hoping for some tailored advice about my situation. Does the fact that Ivy seems to crave cat interaction mean I'll have a better chance of making a cat pair work? Would it be cruel not to try? (Okay ""cruel"" is a bit dramatic, but you know what I mean.) Even though Ivy is enthusiastic about a new cat friend now, will this fade over time and is there a chance they'll just get into fights later? Is Ivy and Isaac's occasional playtime enough to satisfy him?

For those who vote yes adopt another cat, any advice about age/sex etc? I personally think Ivy is a bit of a ladies' man and would love a female companion around his age, but I'm open to suggestions.

I would honestly prefer not to adopt another cat right now because I live in a small two-bedroom apartment with a giant dog and a cat, so I'd struggle for space. And the idea of adopting a cat only to find that it won't work out is quite stressful. But it also breaks my heart to hear Ivy calling out to the neighbour's cat to play and getting no response.

As a compromise, I was actually thinking of waiting until Isaac passes, since he's quite old, and adopting another cat then, to help both Ivy and myself grieve. This may not happen for several years, however, and I do feel bad for Ivy in the meantime.

1668979598,self.CatAdvice,True,"5 months ago we found a kitty(Romeo) all alone on our farm. Decided to take him into our home as we couldn‚Äôt bring our selves to just leave him there. Very cute, innocent and tiny. He had fun with my other cats as he was smaller but now its getting out of hand as he is bigger and faster now

My other cats are Rick (4.5yrs old) and Cheeto (3.5yrs old) are very peaceful and sometimes play fight with each other. Now romeo, while he was tiny, would play fight with rick and cheeto as much as he could. Typical fun kitten behavior that was really fun/cute to watch. The problem now is Romeo with his kitten levels of energy is a little too crazy. He sprints full speed and attempts to mount both rick and cheeto on sight every day and every opportunity he gets. Rick is a stronger, more ‚Äúalpha‚Äù cat while cheeto is the definition of a scaredy cat, pretty weak, innocent and affectionate which im totally fine with.

My problem is my other cats are starting to slightly change and I can tell sometimes they are distressed. My main concern is cheeto because romeo can smell the weakness off cheeto and enjoys what id consider bullying cheeto. Sometimes I catch him just growling when romeo is in the vicinity. I understand its the age difference and energy levels which contribute to the incompatibility but my family is starting to get annoyed and although they like romeo, due to his behavior they dont like him as much as the other cats because of his behavior. I can live with them not really playing with romeo as my family doesnt really know what goes into cat owner ship but I play with romeo 2 hours a day and it‚Äôs difficult playing with him that much just for his energy levels to be at 90% and launch at my other cats. Cheeto yelps is very vocal as he‚Äôs being chased as he runs and Rick play fights with romeo One out of every 10 times Romeo chases him. But when Rick is hissing telling him to f off essentially romeo doesnt stop, same with cheeto. Romeo always tries to bite the back of Rick‚Äòs leg near his butt and it looks like Rick is really bothered by it.

I really need romeo to take it at least one step back and not bully my other cats. I really feel that romeo knows what hes doing is bad but he gets off to it. How do I get him to stop attacking cheeto on sight? I understand kittens are crazy but I think hes taking it too far. I keep cheeto in our big/nice basement with all his necessities with the door to upstairs closed as he spends most of his time down there anyway. 
It‚Äôs really difficult doing this on my own and I don‚Äôt want my family to continue being annoyed with him. I don‚Äôt know where to find a professional behaviourist or at least a reliable one. Will neutering Romeo bring this behaviour down a notch?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much

I have a shelf in my room where I grow some plants under a grow light (there is no window!!) and he's become hellbent on getting up there--probably because he knows it gets my attention. I've done everything in my power to block off the shelf, and he still barges through it all, even if he falls or it's nearly impossible to make the jump. When I remove him from successful attempts, he finds something in my room other than the Two Whole Litter Boxes in the room to pee on. 

He's gotten along great with the other three cats, even plays with the younger two regularly. I thought he was doing this because he was restless, so I started playing hard with him before bed. Then I thought he was obsessed with the shelf because I kept the cat food in the cabinet, so I moved it out of the room. Finally  because he ended up getting up earlier than me, I decided to start opening my room door so he could go downstairs with the other cats while I finish sleeping. Nope, he still comes back in and tries to get up there, and once more when I remove him, he guns straight for my closet or chair to piss on something.

I'm at the end of my rope.

Midnight ‚Ä¢ Neighbors cat who is always at our house, eats &amp; sleeps here most of her time ‚Ä¢ Female ‚Ä¢ about 8 months old ‚Ä¢ Unsure about being Spaded ‚Ä¢ Neighbor found her at 2 weeks old, been coming here since four months old ‚Ä¢ (Not ours but came in as Third Kitty) 

So our new kitty, who we had for a little more than a month, keeps being bullied terrorized by our first cat Manju. Manju is usually the most friendliest of all cats, &amp; of all the cats we thought Manju would be the first person to take to her, but he wasn‚Äôt. Everytime he sees her, he makes his shoulders big &amp; turn into a gorilla &amp; chases her down looking like he has gorilla shoulders &amp; smacks her, with claws. I‚Äôm not joking, he actually resembles a gorilla. i know it‚Äôs him showing dominance. My bestfriend says he‚Äôs getting ‚Äúbigger‚Äù because she made him feel ‚Äúsmall‚Äù when he was trying to get to know her.

in reality, i know I made a few mistakes when introducing.

1. Fae was in the house when Manju was outside laying &amp; playing around (gone) with the other cats in the backyard. so he wasn‚Äôt home when she arrived.
2. I wasn‚Äôt aware of Fae‚Äôs personality before I adopted her. now i do see that plays a big major role. (learned alot of lessons this last adoption) her personality is very scary. Like she‚Äôs extremely scared of everything. i think before the person she was adopted from. (it was an older lady who had Fae since about 7 months, so she had her for about 6 months before we adopted her, said that Fae is the only cat she was allergic to &amp; had to give her away but didn‚Äôt want to surrender her to a shelter. after she gave Fae to us, she got a new cat the following week &amp; says that she‚Äôs not allergic to this one.) Fae doesn‚Äôt really have any extremely concerning behavior issues, but she is scared of everything. When Manju is out the house, she free roams, smells everyone‚Äôs butts weirdly a lot, loves to play, loves to be pet, doesn‚Äôt really socialize a lot , very to herself most of the time, all movements &amp; noises scare her. I think before the last woman, she was somewhere where she had to fend for herself &amp; it was dangerous. I would say, most times it‚Äôs not dangerous in our house but it does get a little worrysome whenever Manju wants to attack her. This happens about 2-3 a day. 
3. When Manju met Fae, for two days he would go up to her sniff her &amp; always lay by her. Later on the second day, he was smelling her face again, she hissed at him, swatted him &amp; ever since then he‚Äôs been going gorrilla mode every single time he sees her.

Peanut Butter doesn‚Äôt really care about Fae too much, Manju hates her, Midnight plays with her a lot &amp; Fae plays back but Fae body slams her a lot &amp; Fae plays extremely hard, so I‚Äôm always confused if they are playing or it‚Äôs serious. 

All of the other cats go outside, lay in the sun, climb the trees, lay on our roofs, play in the grass, &amp; Fae watches them from the window all the time. Fae is too scared to go outside. 

I feel like is Fae wasn‚Äôt as scared &amp; more free flowing she would have gotten along well with everyone but She‚Äôs extremely scared. Now I feel like she‚Äôs found herself in an environment, that she‚Äôs not always getting attacked but it does happen. She definitely feels happier when everyone‚Äôs outside because she freeroams, She‚Äôs free roaming the house when Manju is outside, &amp; the other cats are inside.

But i‚Äôm reality, i‚Äôm just concerned &amp; dk what to do. I‚Äôve tried to get them both to accept eachother, but Fae will just swat at him when he isn‚Äôt doing anything &amp; he‚Äôll turn into a fucking gorilla &amp; swat her when he sees her. 

Honestly i feel like she‚Äôll do better in a home where there‚Äôs no other cats. but i also don‚Äôt want her to just be passed around because she‚Äôs been going home to home but now in my home, she‚Äôs not fully safe whenever Manju decides he just wants to go gorilla.

I would love to find a solution to how to make them co-exist but i‚Äôm starting to feel like it‚Äôll just be better to give her to someone who can provide a better home for her, a safer home.",CatAdvice,HELP! I need advice. New Cat moved in.,

One day in the cold of winter  I came back to my Mom's and went down to the kid's house and he wasn't there, I haven't seen him since.

It's been a little over a year now and I've been wanting another cat, I don't want to make the same mistake again--so I thought of just taking them with me.

1668922274,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey all. My fiance and I adopted two kittens back in June, one was 8 months old (Brown Tabby), the other (lynx point Siamese domesticated mix), 6 months. I sit here watching our two girls groom each other as inspiration for this post. 

We visited our local shelter back in June and fell in love with these two kittens. While they both came from Texas, they never actually interacted and obviously came from different litters. 

I see people here say that it takes days to weeks to introduce cats. Well...we didn't wait, and did not ease into it at all. We were going to, but just felt as if we didn't need to. 

When we brought them home into our home, we put their cages face to face for about 30 seconds. Then, we let them out of their cages. They sniffed each other, and within, without exaggeration, a minute, they were chasing, tumbling, playing and clearly having a blast and were obviously enjoying socializing. The tabby gave a quick hiss after about 10 minutes...the other kitten respected the boundary, sat for a bit, then they continued playing. They got along so well, that we felt okay leaving them alone in a room together over night! 

We woke up the next morning for work to find them cuddling. Fast forward 5 months, and nothing has changed. They love each other and are the best of friends. They still play and tumble and chase and groom. The tabby will usually give a hiss when she doesn't want to play, and the Siamese mix always respects the boundary and there's never been any hard feelings. 

As I read more about this, I see most people take weeks to introduce their cats. Maybe we weren't wise to introduce them immediately, but I've never seen two cats get along like this.

Hi,

A friend of mine has a neighbor with an 8 year old male cat who has not been using his litter box for a few months and has been relieving himself on the sofa, in his cat carrier, etc. instead. He's only recently started doing so for about two months, although he's been house-trained and had been good about using the litter box until then. They took him to the vet to get him checked out health-wise--apparently he's fine, and the vet suggested that there may be an environmental factor. The neighbor is an elderly lady who has some dementia issues, so it's likely that she had been unable to properly take care of him. They've also reached out to the local cat rescue agency, but they want the cat to be chipped and fully vaccinated before taking him in. The elderly lady wasn't sure of how many vaccines the cat had received and likely does not have enough money to pay for getting him chipped, etc.

I'm considering taking in the cat to see if he can fare better in a less chaotic situation, but wanted to ask for advice on how to prepare myself in taking in a likely very stressed out cat with litter box issues (Aka, how to prepare him to get adjusted to the new stressors of moving, what things would be best to entice him to use the litter box, what materials would be best to clean cat waste, etc.). I would also be happy to hear of any other potential avenues forward for this kitty.

1668864818,self.CatAdvice,True,"     So to begin, I'm in my 3rd home at 17y/o with my truly extraordinary catto named Rocky. Due to some unfortunate circumstances we were forced to leave said 3rd home and in doing so my family had split apart and started doing their own things. From this event I had to move very very suddenly into my new home (of which my room is miniscule and is the only room Rocky can be in, explanation for this further down). Here is some backstory on my new home and the animals that live here. 

     So during Rocky's first 3-4 years of life he was steadily gaining privilege to go outside unsupervised. (I live in coyote and raccoon territory and God knows what else, so I had trained him to come back into my home before dark and to let him out after dawn for his further safety.) Now I will introduce 2 other cats that are a large issue, A older but 1.5x larger cat than Rocky, named Buddy, and another 1.25x larger black cat named Jet (Rocky is about 12.5lbs for reference as to these cats sizes). These 2 would always antagonize Rocky whilst he was outside so they absolutely hate each other.

      Now to where this all comes together, so the home I was forced to move into, the lady/roommate/landlord Kim owns 1 dog and somewhere between 7-9 different cats. 2 of those also happen to be Buddy and Jet. So from this sudden move into a shoebox sized room with my indoor with outdoor privileges cat where I am near forced to contain him solely to my room. He has been neutered as well and so has Jet and Buddy, and he has 24/7 fresh accomodations so he doesnt feel as bad about being stuck in my room. 

     Yet, regardless of this, I can still tell he's depressed and anxious and longs to go outside. I live in a mountainous region where we will likely get snow consistently soon from the winter storms. I was planning on constructing a catio for him and still think that's a good plan, but I want knowledge of every option at my disposal as to, hopefully, help Rocky be happier. I don't think I can leash train him in my room as of the extremely small size but I'm not sure so that's why I'm asking these questions on here. 

     His depression, in turn, makes mine worse in all aspects, as whilst he isn't a registered support animal, he basically is for me and him being in any discomfort or sadness or anything of that sort heightens my problems, whilst also not knowing what to do about it or how to fix it and I need this to stop for both him and me so we both can have a healthy future.

She has a wide water bowl (to avoid her whiskers touching the side) and a pet fountain but I've never seen her drink from the fountain (just try and hit the water with her paws lol). I stayed buying her bottled mineral water and she seems to drink from her bowl a bit more now but not that often, the water level doesn't go down much.

Her diet consists of 1 and a half 100g pouches of wet food a day with some dry food to graze on. She's a very small cat and doesn't eat much but I'm considering upping her pouches to 2 a day with less dry food. Would 1.5 to 2 pouches provide enough hydration that she doesn't need to drink much or is this a problem?

My main questions right now are, is she likely getting enough water with the wet food already or:

1) Should I try adding water to her wet food?

2) Should I add more wet food if she seems to be a healthy weight? She's filled out a little bit but seems to be a good size for her age, I'm worried about her getting chubby

So, we have two in-house cats, Beef(female &amp; neutered) and Kathrine(female &amp; unknown)- but Beef originally came to us as practically feral and very young. We got her fixed, medicated, etc.

Another cat(Spicy Chicken) who looks like Beef in coloring and age and we're pretty sure that they're from the same litter- has finally warmed up to us and has given birth in our indoor porch area. We likely won't be able to keep Spicy Chicken as she's our neighbor's cat (though I say screw them for neglecting her yet still claiming ownership of her) but in the meantime we want the kittens to stay with us since it's getting pretty cold out. And this is actually the second time Spicy Chicken has been pregnant but we're pretty sure that none of the kittens from that litter made it as we saw no signs of them. The worry I have is Kathrine, she's lovely and sweet but not great with other cats and has shown some aggression toward Spicy Chicken in the past.

1668822345,self.CatAdvice,True," So back in July I trapped a litter of 5 kittens. I trapped their mother as well and had her fixed and released her (she was feral). Kittens were about 6 weeks old at the time and feral and oh so spicy! I have 2 cats of my own, so I have been taking care of 7 cats for about 4 months now. I‚Äôm 7.5 months pregnant and due in January, so I know I will need to give them up at some point. 
I have been rehabilitating them since July and getting them used to people. These kittens were so skittish and shy and still even after 4 months, really need work. I have come to realize that they need more help than I can provide. I have been working with an amazing organization and regularly attending adoption events to try and get them adopted- I have been consistently giving up my weekends to volunteer at these events. 2/5 have been adopted and returned. So the organization offered to let me move them to the adoption center and have a variety of people come in 2x per day to take care of them in order to socialize them. 
These kittens and I have been through a lot together - so Im really attached to them- all of them not just one in particular. I love them all in different ways. I rescued them, rehabilitated them, been through 2 rounds of ringworm with them, loved them, cared for them, fed them, etc for the last 4 months. So, I would like to keep one of them.

The other a female gray tabby that loves our family but nobody else, really.

With the female, I worry about behavior issues when I leave town or have strangers in the home. But I also worry that the female has only ever bonded with me and will never give anyone else a chance. 
I don‚Äôt worry about the male, he will be ok wherever he goes - here or adopted out. 
Do I take the female who I know is bonded with us and will likely have a harder time being adopted out? Or take the easier male that everyone in our home loves?

1668818252,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a reactive dog at home and I need some suggestions for how to quickly make sure that he gets adjusted to kittens. My roommates and I are planning to adopt 2 kittens next year to take care of in our apartment. Two of my three (four including myself) roommates have experience with kittens, so taking care of them shouldn't be a problem. My concern lies back home. My family dog is an anxiety riddled five year old miniature Australian Shepherd. He has always had issues with other animals and people, often barking and growling at any sudden movements, but adjusts relatively quickly. He's never had issues with attacking other animals except for the occasional nip at other dogs at the park when they get too close to me (he's a big barker and chaser as he's a herding dog). Despite this knowledge, I'm unsure how he'd react to a cat, especially kittens. He's never been around one before, the only non-dog interaction was a bunny that he didn't care much about. Ideally I wouldn't take the risk of introducing him to kittens, especially since I intend to get them from a local rescue, but I am obligated to get them registered as Emotional Support Animals. I have depression and have struggled a bit this year without my dog to keep me company. The apartment complex we will be staying in is one of the few locations that we will be allowed to stay in next year, and the only one that doesn't require a subway. They don't allow normal pets, but they do allow ESAs (Emotional Support Animals). I initially intended to get a dog, but my roommates and I agree that cats would likely be easier. Due to them having to be registered as my ESAs, and my roommates being unable to take them home, I have no choice but to taken them home over winter break, and any other long term break.

I've been considering the idea of bringing the kittens home 2 weeks before the semester start date to get them adjusted to my dog. I'm hoping that if they're introduced at a young age, even for a short period of time, that their inevitable reintroduction for winter break will be much less stressful. I'm sure that a longer introduction period would be better but I need to work most of the summer to make enough money to last me through the semester, and support the two new babies! I was wondering if two weeks would be enough, and how to ensure that my dog and kittens meeting goes as seamlessly as possible. I've read quite a bit about slow exposure, so I've been planning to do that. I'm mostly concerned that since he barks quite a lot that they could end up traumatized.

Another concern I have is how to avoid damage to the apartment furniture. Is there a way to keep cats from scratching, and potentially damaging the furniture? I wouldn't normally have an issue (my dog is very destructive) but the apartment comes pre-furnished. Any product recommendations, training, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

I also want to know how much attention kittens likely will need!! They will be coming from a foster home so I'm not sure if that would make a difference. I will try and make as much time for them as possible, but life gets in the way and my dog is quite needy so there might be times where I have to leave them with a family member or alone for periods of time. I want to ensure that they get as much love as possible :)

I'm not planning to get them until late August, I don't even know what they look like (we do have a vision of two male cats: a black one named Noctis, and a brown one named Leon, but we aren't too picky). I just want to make sure I'm not making any mistakes and that I'm as prepared as possible!! Also! Any product recommendations like litters boxes, carrying cages, and towers would be lovely!!

1668808116,self.CatAdvice,True,"This is a weird story, I think. It started last night. 

I have two cats: Rosie is 5 and my sensitive girl. She's very sweet, but skittish and scares kind of easily, but that's actually been getting better. Then there's Phinley: my sweet, funny boy. He turned 2 in July. He likes to play a little more rough than she does, but they seemed to have figured that out. She actually plays by herself when she's in the mood. He's the same way now. There's never been much strife between them that I could see, except for once when Rosie (I think) came back from a dental cleaning last year and he treated her like a complete stranger for several days. They hissed and growled at each other, and made that weird noise that cats make when they're freaked out; that lar-a-lar-a-lar noise. We also just got back home from 9 months in California. They were fine there, but Rosie wasn't happy. She just slept a lot in her little scratcher bunker. She's been a lot better since we've been home. Happier, more comfortable and content. My girl. 

So last night, I was sitting in bed while she was curled up in my lap asleep. Phinley was in his little cavern bed on the floor, maybe 5 feet from the bed. All of the sudden, Rosie jerked awake and flew up into the air like something scared the hell out of her. Or hurt her. She took off for the living room as soon as she hit the floor, with Phinley right behind her. When I walked out there, I found him half wedged under the chair, and heard growling and hissing, so she was under the chair as well. That's one of her safe spots. So he hears me and crawls back out. I figured she needed a minute (or several), so Phin and I chilled in the bedroom again to give her time. Then I went to check on her. She was in a different spot, and when she saw Phin, she hissed and growled and ran up the cat tree. He took off after her and made that weird warble sound. I hadn't heard that in a while. 

Basically, it's still like this. I kept him in the room with me until about 5am and kept the door closed. She cried all night and they kind of played with each other under the door. It's a weird apartment and the bottom of the door leaves a good sized gap between it and the floor. At 5am, I opened the door to feed them and take my meds. She busted through the opening door and jumped over him, then onto her other perch. He immediately followed her and stared up at her, making that warbling noise again. So I picked her up to get her out safely and when I started to walk out, I felt his claws kinda dig into my legs. Wtf. Like he was trying to get at her. 

Eventually I was able to call the vet and they said to let them figure it out, but to be aware so that I could douse them in water or throw a blanket on them if needed. Ok. I let them see each other. She was in her favorite spot in the back of the apartment. I switched their areas earlier and slept in the living room with him. She's better about being left alone. They've both eaten and done their litter box stuff by this time. Anyways, I open the door and he immediately makes a beeline towards her. She growling, ears down, in the defensive stance on top of the dresser where she loves to sleep. He made that warble noise and is aggressively rubbing all over the spot he's on, occasionally staring her down. Mostly flopping all over and rubbing. Idk if this is a territorial / hierarchy thing, but it was weird. At one point, he did jump up to her spot and they threw paws at each other, spat, hissed, growled. He backed off then; but even now, 7 hours later, he's still trying to approach her and she's clearly not having it. I just picked up two multicat feliway kits and dosed him with gabapentin per the vet instructions. I can't get her to take it and she's under the bed. But wtf?

She does 1 &amp; 2 in her cat box usually but is seemingly spite peeing on soft surfaces. She peed on the couch last night which I cleaned thoroughly with enzymatic cleaner. This morning she peed on the blanket at the other end of the couch. Both times staring me dead in the eyes. She has peed on our bed and spare blankets in the past. She goes a month or two without issues then does this a couple times a day for about a week straight. 

I read somewhere to put treats on frequent urination places to associate food with places she shouldn't pee and have tried that as well. It works for a little while then she's right back to it, treats or no treats.

Me and my partner adopted a cat from the shelter about a month ago. She was found on the streets back in August and came to the shelter with a broken leg (which is now healed) and seems to have been a house cat but noone came to claim her. She's two years old and looks to be a British Shorthair (she's not a fan of being picked up for long) and she seems to be used to us and comfortable with us.
Now she's quite active (I do try to play with her daily) and she loves birdwatching from the window, so I think she'd love the outside. We have a harness that she seems mostly okay with, we've put it on her  many times to get her accustomed to it. I know you're supposed to go slow and step by step. We live in a small apartment building, on the first floor and it has a tall fenced in yard, which is where I'd like to take her, going outside would mean going through the hall and down one set of stairs.
So far we've tried to go outside twice, once she wriggled out of the harness while we were putting on shoes by the door. I've adjusted the harness since then. The second time we got her to the door and to go a step into the hall by using a laser pointer and treats but she retreated back into the apartment.
So far Ive been thinking to get her used to going into the hall and exploring there and then moving outside when she gets more comfortable, but maybe I should put her in her carrier and go outside and let her come out and explore then (on a leash ofc)?

A little bit of backstory:
My grandmother found her just a few months old outside and took her in. Since she could not keep her at that time, I took her in. At around 8-9 months, she started peeing on my bed and sofa and I figured that it‚Äôs due to hormones and got her spayed. The peeing stopped!
Fast forward, this summer I brought her to my grandmother‚Äôs place, since she was living in the countryside and I thought that she would like to run around outside instead of always being in my flat. She spent there 2 months and then my grandmother had to move, so I took her back. I was temporarily staying at my boyfriends place, which was a very small studio. She started to constantly pee everywhere. I thought maybe it was due to a medical issue and took her to the vet, but that was not it. Then I realised that maybe she just does not like the new space since it was so small. So I asked my grandmother to look after her for a bit until I get my place back. By that time, my grandmother had already moved to another place and is living in a flat, so my cat did not spend any time outside when she was with her. She did not pee once, until after a month, when my mom came for the weekend and she peed on my mom‚Äôs bed. My mom then brought her back to me since I moved back to my place. And ever since then (about a month) she‚Äôs peeing either on my sofa or my bed. She has 3 litter boxes, I clean them everyday. The are all located in private areas, easily accesible though. I thought, maybe she is jealous of my boyfriend (although they always play together, he feeds her sometimes and seem to be vibing well), so asked him to stay at his place for a week and see if that might be the issue. For a few days it was fine, but then the peeing started again. I read that someone had the same issue, so started feeding the cat on the sofa, since cat‚Äôs don‚Äôt do their business where they eat, however, today while I was on the sofa, she peed on me.

My family and I adopted her from a local shelter as a Christmas present for me in 2016, and we really don't know anything about her past. She was kind of getting bullied by this fat tabby, which is one of the reasons I chose to adopt her. She can be a bit temperamental, but she's an amazing addition to our family.

Now, getting into my question. I've been wanting to get another cat for a while, as I'm a cat person, and since the passing of my dog a few years ago I've missed having several pets in the house. My cat, however, I don't think would be very thrilled at the idea. She's had some issues with both cats and dogs in the past- she'll hiss at neighborhood cats she can see from the window, and if my sister or family friends ever bring their dog over she'll smack and hiss at them. The dog I had mentioned before was a teenage chocolate lab that we had before we brought Zuzu home. Although she was wary and a bit aggressive at first, she did warm up to him a lot, and they became good friends (never any aggressive behavior, cuddling together, etc). He was a big pushover, and never barked, snapped, or even paid any attention to her when she would hiss at or smack him. This probably played a role in how well she liked him, as any dog with especially high energy or interest in her she absolutely despised. I should also mention that about a year ago, she had gotten a stressed induced UTI after we babysat a friend's dog for two weeks, and we have since refused to have any dog over for more than a few hours.

So what I'm getting at is, would it be a bad idea to see if she would open up to another animal in the house? I know she has the capacity to be chill with other animals, as she was with my lab, but I also worry about causing her any sort of significant stress and getting another UTI. I thought maybe if the cat had a very chill temperament like my past dog that it would be easier, but I just don't know. My desire for another cat aside, I also ask because my mom's boyfriend may be moving in with us soon, and he would likely bring his 14-year-old dog. The two have had a few interactions, and my cat wasn't as aggressive or defensive as she has been with other dogs, but I'm still concerned about it. Any advice or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.",CatAdvice,Would it be a bad idea to try and socialize my cat?,

Now the issues is I‚Äôve had some health issues come up and will have to move move from Canada to Jordan for at least the next 4 months. I want to take the cat with me.

1668708895,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat had a really rocky start to life. We found out she had trichomoniasis after months of vomiting, loose stools, and initial diagnosis of failure to thrive. She initially was obsessed with wet food but was prescribed Hills prescription biome food. Well we could not find the canned food anywhere due to the pandemic shortage so we switched her to the kibble version as that was the only food she tolerated. After putting her on rinadazole, we were able to wean off the prescription food. Since then, wet food has been very rocky and she is extremely picky. One day she will eat it, another day she absolutely refuses to touch it. We eventually caved and got her Tiki carnivore kibble which she absolutely loves, however, it made her litter box smell horrendous the minute she goes in it. We ended up eventually switching to fresh pet Vital cat food and she loved it at first for about a year and the litter box issue disappeared. Now she‚Äôs refusing to eat it and will only eat the kibble. We tried introducing wet food again and she wasn‚Äôt into it. She‚Äôs a very happy cat and loves her freeze dried chicken treats and will eat the kibble so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs refusing to eat all together.

1668707109,self.CatAdvice,True,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible. My 15 yo cat is recovering from a nasty URI that I suspect she got from one of the cats that frequents our yard. She was my landlord's cat that they left at the house when they moved to be cared for by tenants (weird I know). She needed some expensive medical care for her URI that I ended up paying for, resulting in my landlords handing over ownership.

The issue is that she is indoor/outdoor and has been for her entire life. I would personally prefer to have my cats remain indoors, and if she was indoor only she likely would not have contracted a URI. She doesn't stray from the yard so my concern is the cats that come in from other houses. She has started begging to go back out and I just feel so bad, because I know she loves to bask in the sun and watch the neighborhood through the fence. I do play with her when she's around and would be willing to do that more to keep her entertained indoors...

The other issue is I have 3 roommates and I anticipate her getting out again just by their lack of observation or care. One of them often has a dog visitor that goes in and out so I would need to ask that the sliding door remains closed at all times. I'm considering just blocking any entry/exit points in the yard that I can find to prevent other cats coming around, but I would be risking another expensive health scare.

I've had a cat spayed before at a much older age but it was so long ago I honestly don't remember much of the aftercare. So my first question is the 10 to 14 days that seems to be the most common recommendation for the recovery period. It's frustrating because i don't know that means is 10 days okay or do i need to wait the entire 14 days it makes no sense to me. I don't have a primary vet at the moment so it's not something i can ask them. As for my second question after these 10 to 14 days can my kitten resume normal activity. One thing that concerns me is that i have another cat that is about 6 months old and they love to play and sometimes that can be somewhat aggressive with each other.

Me and my boyfriend we have a 2year old cat that was found on the street but he was already quite used to humans. 
Yesterday a friend of ours called us to say he had a cat living inside his walls for the last 2 weeks and he finally manage to get him out. It's a baby cat no more than 2 months old. 
I couldn't in good consicous leave the kitten outside in the street with the cold temperatures, wind and rain that we've been having. So we took the stray cat in tonight. 
He's terrified and dehydrated. I'm taking him/her to the vet tomorrow to do a full check up. 

Now my question, how do I get a stray kitten used to humans and to another cat? How do j get my other cat used to the kitten? I wanna do this properly to have a chance of keeping the kitten (if last case scenario they really sont get along I already have a friend that will take the kitten in). 

I've currently closed the kitten in a division with water, food, bed, litter, and I'm giving him space but my older cat is curious and goes to put his paw under the door to check on the kitten.

When we first got him he played normally, but for the past month and a half he sometimes will growl after catching the toy and tries to go hide it (usually under the bed). He's even done this while we weren't playing w him - he'll sometimes see one of his stick toys and will grab it and start taking it to hide, but he'll pass the doorway into the bedroom, which has a hanging mouse toy, and try to grab that at the same time.

1668655097,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a mother son cat duo, the mother was originally a pregnant stray and we adopted out all her kittens but one, they‚Äôre about 2 and 3 years old now both neutered. she‚Äôs a pretty timid squirreley cat, occasionally affectionate but usually very independent, the son is more social, loud and clingy. They‚Äôve never been particularly aggressive toward one another besides some territorial growling over cardboard boxes, they don‚Äôt mind eating in the same room, they‚Äôre civil, but they‚Äôve never bonded. They don‚Äôt groom each other, sleep, or play together, sometimes the son tries to initiate play but she starts growling and her body language implies she‚Äôs irritated so I separate them.

Some other random context;
-The growling and helicopter ears from mom only seems to happen when she is in my room with me, and the son enters
-she‚Äôs more defensive than aggressive, like she‚Äôs afraid of him but I have no idea why since in two years I‚Äôve never seen him attack/bother her, he just seems confused by her reaction
-I give both of them catnip, I know it makes them behave strangely but not sure if aggression is a side affect
-she was neutered first, but we had to wait until he was about a year old to neuter the son because appointments were impossible during covid

1668653440,self.CatAdvice,True,"I (21) recently adopted a male kitten who is around 5-6 months old about 2 weeks ago. For context, he is neutered and caught up on vaccinations and all that. I basically ""fell in love"" as they say, from volunteering at a cat rescue several times a week and seeing him over the course of a couple of months. Eventually, I realized I would be sad if he weren't there to greet me and I thought I could handle it, so I decided to adopt (with encouragement from my family and friends).

I was really happy at first, went all out buying toys and perches and things. The first days went pretty well too - obviously, there were a lot of adjustments on both our parts, but I was feeling good and I was happy to have a companion. After the first weekend, though, I feel like I've started to freak out. I feel like my adoption was on a whim and out of panic that he would be adopted by someone else and I'm worried I made the wrong choice.

The kitten does what kittens do - climb up all over the counters, eating the houseplants I tried to keep high and out of sight (non-toxic to cats I've checked already), waking me up all hours of the night, scratching me, knocking things all over, etc. I expected some of this, since I had a cat growing up, but I have never had a kitten before (we got my previous cat when he was a few years old already). The issue though is that this is bothering me more than I expected.

When the kitten is on the stove or the fridge, which is where I tried to hide the houseplants, I get more irritated than I ever have been before. When the cat is chewing on the cables or chewing on the plants (even though I got him his own cat grass that is easily accessible) it just makes me...angry. I'm so frustrated by the needs of this creature that I am suddenly responsible for, and that I try my best to provide for him but he still causes problems (I know that's not how cat brains work...but it's hard to change how it comes across to a human thought process). 

As time goes on, I dislike the kitten more and more it seems. I feel bad that I hold his behavior against him, but I don't know how to let go. I know that cats don't respond well to negative reinforcement, but it is hard to overcome the primal urge to scream when I see him jumping on the curtains. After he does those things and then tries to cuddle up to me, I don't feel better - I feel worse. I just want him to leave me alone at that point.

1668648081,self.CatAdvice,True,"We adopted two cats in a short amount of time. We first adopted a kitten that has a bit of CH in early September. Wanted to get him a playmate but was hoping to not get an aggressive kitten that could hurt him since he can't really jump away, climb stairs, and is less able to defend himself. Kitten is a very social, energetic, and sweet cat. Through a rescue, we adopted a 1.5 year old female cat who was described as super loving and super social. She was in a foster home with other cats, dogs, and lots of children around, and also super attentive to the kittens. She was found pregnant on the side of the road and was luckily rescued and gave birth at the foster home. She came to us in mid October.

When she first arrived, we kept the cats separate since neither were fixed, but started feeding them on either side of closed doors. It's been a few weeks since they've both been fixed and they've both recovered. They're able to eat on either side of a baby gate in full sight of each other with no issues. We started letting them in the same room together for short periods, and the kitten has learned to be wary of the older cat and not pounce as much because that'll get him swatted at. However, older cat will approach just to hiss at kitten. I'm worried that older cat will get territorial of the main floor of the house, which is the kitten's space and since he can't climb stairs, it's really his only space he can access without someone carrying him up or down. 

Is the hissing at kitten normal or is she being a bully? She'll relax in his presence and groom herself, but will also just hiss for no reason at all.

The female is 3kg and male is 3.5, weighed this morning before breakfast.

The female kitten has shown me she can self regulate, very occasionally leave a bit of food. The male one will clean his bowl to the point it looks washed and then go on to clean hers. Also meows for food when he sees me getting their bowl. 

I'm currently feeding them 300 calories give or take. 3 main meals of wet food, 1-2 snacks of wet food pouches shared between them, and dry food as treats before bed (5-6 varying meals a day). When they split food I gave the male one a bit more. 

I have conflicting info... The pouches say ~3-3.5 pouches for their age, which is ~240-280 kcals. But other websites (untamed list of kcal for kitten weight, not age) say ~400 kcal for 3.5kg.

For some background on my dog: she gets along with other dogs, she had been to pet hotels and is always fine being in the room with the dogs, but I am not sure how she is with cats.

So I tried a warm washcloth. This cat LOVES this, he lets me wipe down almost his whole body, purrs like it‚Äôs the best thing ever, and then waits until I am done and even lets me towel dry him. 

I know this isn‚Äôt necessarily normal, but I just hope it isn‚Äôt bad for him or indicative of any health issues.",CatAdvice,Cat Likes Being Bathed,

For example, I bought a baby gate between my cat's safe space (my office) and the rest of the apartment so that way when we moved onto the next step of them visually seeing each other (again but in a controlled environment) there would be a barrier. 

The problem is that my roommates cat keeps charging the gate whenever I try to get out, trying to push it open, scratching the gate, and swipes at my cat in the space under the door when it's closed. I told my roommate he needs to spend more time with his cat, to exhaust her or find ways to distract his cat so that way the door isn't the most interesting thing. He bought a toy that pops out treats but other than that hasn't done much. His cat continues to wait right outside the door for any chance to run up and attack my cat.

1668609163,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm coming to the wonderful Reddit community today as I fear I‚Äôm going slightly insane and I could really do with some advice. Details below:

I grew up with cats, all of them with different personalities (as they tend to have) and I really missed having that fun feline companionship once I moved out almost 9 years ago. For years all I wanted was to have my own cat again and two months ago that dream finally became reality when my new landlord agreed that we (me and my partner of many years) could have one in our house. 

I immediately contacted our local shelter and told them that we would be more than happy to take on a more senior cat that might have been overlooked due to their age or looks before because none of that mattered very much to me, all I wanted was a little cuddle bug that would enjoy hanging out with me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, cats are still cats and having grown up around them I am well aware that they don‚Äôt always want to be loved on and sometimes just wanna be left alone which, again, completely fine I just wanted a somewhat healthy, mostly affectionate little cat to call my own.

They were incredibly lovely and informed me that they had a great fit for us, an almost 10 year old little lady, that they told us whilst very shy at first, was also very affectionate. I was incredibly happy and a few days later we went to pick her up. Staff warned us that she wasn‚Äôt having a good day and was hiding in her igloo, but since we were warned that she was a timid cat ahead of time I didn‚Äôt let it bother me, I knew that she was just very scared. They told us that she came from a multi pet plus kids household where she hid for most of the day and would barely come out because she was very unsettled by all the goings on, hence why she was rehomed. We took her home that same day still.

She‚Äôs a very cute cat and after hiding for most of the day for the first few weeks she‚Äôs started to come out of her shell and will now sleep on the sofa or the bed instead of hiding somewhere in the house out of sight. She‚Äôs even super playful still and its very cute to watch.

Now my (would like to make it very clear that this is indeed a me problem, the cat is a cat and has obviously not done anything wrong) problem: 
She doesn‚Äôt like to be touched much or hang out with me. She will meow for attention in the mornings and evenings when she wants to be fed or wants someone to throw her toy around for her but won‚Äôt like it if you try and stroke her and evade. When trying to pet her when she‚Äôs sitting down she will gently swat at you or get up and leave so she clearly doesn‚Äôt enjoy it. She will also spend her time in a different room than me if she can and never really seeks company other than for meal times.

I‚Äôm really sad about it. The rational side of me knows that she‚Äôs just a cat and she doesn‚Äôt know any better but I just feel so heartbroken every time I look at her. I just want her to enjoy being with me, even if she never wants to be held or doted on loads I could live with that as long as she still at least enjoys being around me. But it doesn‚Äôt seem like she does, if anything she avoids me most of the time. I‚Äôve tried being the one who feeds her, bonding over treats and playing. But she just doesn‚Äôt seem to have an much of an interest in interacting with me.

I feel like a horrible person because of how selfish I am being about this. I‚Äôve been crying a lot because I feel like a terrible cat owner that can‚Äôt just accept that they have an independent cat and move on. My partner is getting frustrated with me being so upset about this as well and has told me that I need to stop being this emotional and that she‚Äôll get around to liking me more eventually, but I feel like I‚Äôm getting nowhere. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Has anyone experienced something similar before and if so how did you make yourself get over yourself? How do I stop being so sad about not having the cuddly loving pet I wanted?

Again I know im being ridiculous and acting like a sensitive child, I just don‚Äôt know how to stop so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Note: I would never bring her back to the shelter regardless of my feelings. I made a commitment when I picked her that I would give her the best possible rest of her life I can and that commitment is unconditional.

The two year old has always had a problem waking me up excessively early. Honestly it‚Äôs on &amp; off. Over the past few months though (even before we got the little one) it has been excruciatingly bad.

However, right around 4-5 am (our wake up time is 7) the older one starts. Meowing loudly, scratching at my face to wake my up, walking on my body, jumping on and off the bed. Now she‚Äôs teaching the little one this habit as well.

My parents have asked me to come stay with them this Christmas but I am a little worried about bringing my kitten on the train. 

She will have only had her 1st set of vaccinations at this point (due her booster on December 28th). The journey is 3 hours long and usually is a quiet journey. 

Also my parents have a cat but he is old and blind and does not go outside of there house (don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been in contact with another cat for 2-4 years) and is also fully vaccinated. Their house is also big enough to keep the kitten and my parents cat completely separated if need be.

TLDR: I know for a fact I will be a cat dad one day however my dilemma is whether I should get a cat now and perhaps later in life when I am much more stable and settled. 

My arguments AGAINST getting a cat now:
- I might be moving states or countries in the next year for better work opportunities, should I wait a few more years and settle down and then get a cat?
- I do not have my own car yet, I am worried that regular vet checkups might be a hassle without my own car, ofc I would not want to compromise on my cat‚Äôs health.

My arguments FOR getting a cat now:
- It would be awesome to have my own little goofball, I feel like it would be great for my mental health too, I often work remotely and it can get lonely at times.

jet was raised around different cats for a couple months, because i would always foster 1 additional kitten around his age. eventually, i stopped fostering for a bit and went back to it later (we were fostering liam and ended up adopting him).

initially, they didn‚Äôt like each other, but after slow introductions they have grown to be a bonded pair. they play together, groom one another, cuddle together, etc. 

liam is very affectionate. he follows me around, needs constant attention from me, won‚Äôt let me use the bathroom alone. yk, typical clingy cat stuff.

jet USED to be very affectionate, as a kitten. i know it‚Äôs typical for them to become less affectionate during adolescence and adulthood, but i think this is different. 

jet has grown to run away whenever he sees me step in his direction. his tail is always low- not between his legs, but low. it is either like ‚Äú / ‚Äú or it is slightly curled at the base of his tail, angled downward with a hook at the tip of his tail. he walks around the house with his tail in this position all the time. i would insert a picture but i rarely use reddit and don‚Äôt know how to do that lol. he isn‚Äôt scared to be in my vicinity, but he does not like me approaching him, even if i do so slowly. he sleeps on my bed occasionally, and lets me scratch his chin every once and a while. he rarely lays with his stomach exposed and loafs a LOT.

he generally doesn‚Äôt like being touched, but i am the one who typically has to chase him around cut his nails, give him eyedrops (he has issues with his left eye), and sometimes have to pull him out from under something to do so. and i obviously have to hold him which he doesn‚Äôt enjoy.

Anyways, we were running out of his usual dry food so I went to the grocery store and‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs not there. Ensue panic. It isn‚Äôt available on Amazon except for some overpriced third party sellers. Not available in any store near me. So I go to Petsmart, spend an hour on my phone looking up brands, and finally buy Hills Science Diet Urinary &amp; Hairball Control Adult Dry. 

The reason I got Urinary is because he got diagnosed with FIC last month, he‚Äôs a 1.5yo neutered indoor male cat, I really liked that it‚Äôs formulated specifically for urinary health. I‚Äôm also nervous that the diet change AND us leaving could trigger a FIC episode. I installed a Feliway diffuser today‚Ä¶

I gave him some pieces of his new expensive kibble, he gave it a strong try and ate some, then spit one out. The pieces are bigger and softer than his old kibble. Then I mixed in less than 1/4 into his old food, he hasn‚Äôt tried it yet but to be fair he mostly eats his dry food at night when I‚Äôm asleep. What are the chances of this transition working within the next week?? Should I have tried to transition him to a similar Meow Mix food (maybe Tender Centers or Original)?

i‚Äôve already been stressing out on missing months of school and life in general, but now, the night before we leave, i‚Äôm starting to worry about our 2 cats. 

our only real choice is to keep them in this house. all the airlines to our destination will only ship the cats as cargo (not even necessarily on the same plane). nearby boarding facilities have come back to us saying they can‚Äôt keep them for such a long time. my parents told me to find one of my friends to catsit for us, and there was literally only one that was willing to do it.

the problem is, she‚Äôs really busy and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for her to come out to the middle of nowhere (we live in the middle of nowhere) every day, so my parents told her every other day. i‚Äôm scared this isn‚Äôt often enough.

only one of the cats is fond of playing, and my friend is free to use any of the cat toys lying around (we also have some toys that the cats can play with without assistance).

He's lived the majority of his life so far with me and my 3 other roommates while I was in school. In June of this year I graduated and moved back home with him and a couple weeks after the move he started vomiting a lot. During this period of about 2 weeks he vomited almost once a day if not more and couldn't really keep any food down. Took him to the vet and he had a small fever and they kept him overnight on an IV, gave him antibiotics, blood tests, and x-rays. While there he had no problems keeping food down and nothing was found on the blood tests or x-rays. The fever went away after his stay overnight and I was able to take him home with some medicine to sprinkle on his food for the following 2 weeks. 

Flash forward about 2 and a half months later and he starts vomiting again. Not nearly as much or intensely as the first time but still regularly enough for it to cause concern. I take him back to the vet and they say everything about him is healthy other than that he is a bit underweight ( He's been sitting at 8 lbs ever since July and he's usually 10). They give me deworming meds just in case + some probiotic powder for his food and sent him home. After that he doesn't vomit for about a month and a half but isn't really gaining back any weight. Then about a week ago he began vomiting again about every other day. 

During this time my family and I have tried wet food, single ingredient foods, expensive kibble, kibble for sensitive cats, grain-free kibble, and nothing has been able to stop him from vomiting. He really misses kibble even though most of the time that seems to trigger the vomit and he won't eat that much of his wet food.

Some other key things:

\- He never had anything like this happen in the 3 years I've had him BEFORE we moved this summer

\- Throughout all of this I haven't found any blood in any of his pee, poop, or vomit

\- He has the same levels of energy and acts completely normal after/between vomiting. Whenever he gets his daily zoomies he literally runs laps around the house

You could see the panic in her face. She was finally brave enough to come stand on the sofa with us, where she quietly tinkled and left. We didn't even notice until half hour later.

When I found out, I gave her extra attention and treats and reassured her it's ok to have an accident. You can't imagine the purrs she gave me. I'd like to think I reassured her that she is still my number 1 girl :) Luckily this was a one-off and she resumed standard litter box duties right away.

I have multiple dangly toys (stuffed things attached to a stick with a string, unsure what the correct name is) a few catnip filled stuff toys that I throw for her to chase, as well as a motion activated toy and some noisy balls on a track that she likes to bat around. Sometimes dangling or throwing something works, but a lot of times she seems barely interested in it, she‚Äôll lay on her back and bat it around a little and then get bored and try to attack our hands and feet again.

I have tried my best to clean up after her using enzyme cleaners but she just keeps peeing anyway. She does pee in the litter box when I put her manually and I do keep the litter box clean.

She actually had that habit of peeing outside her litter box since I adopted her at 3 months old but it wasn't as frequent. Anytime she saw any clothing on the bed(even a blanket) or on the floor, she'd pee on it. We managed to get it under control by moving the blankets and clothes from the bed immediately after we're done though she still peed on the couch sometimes.

Will spaying get rid of this peeing problem? I heard the longer a cat is allowed to pee like that during heat, the harder it is to get rid of this habit even after spaying.

They sleep together, groom each other, eat side by side, and other than one particular spot on the cat tower aren't territorial.

I went away this weekend, from Friday to Sunday. They had automatic feeders and my sister checked on them Saturday (I've since checked, she said they were behaving normally). I got home this evening, they didn't come greet me at the door. First I found the older one, then the younger one came in the room but they started hissing at each other. The younger one was also soaking wet (I think they fought near the water bowl as there was a huge puddle), had scratches and was acting terrified while the older one was puffing up and acting like he'd never seen the younger one in his life.

I know this can happen when cats are separated, say a vet visit or something but it has never happened with them after a vet visit or in the rate occasion the older one gets out the house. There was nothing that would have changed how they smelled or seemed to each other. Just my absence and I've left for the weekend before. 

They've been separated since I've been home, the baby mostly with me since he was the most shaken up, though he seems much calmer now. They ate on each a side of a door for dinner. But the older one saw me moving the baby (we were rotating rooms so everyone was set up for the night but isolated rather than their usual run of the house) and he puffed up and started hissing again.

My roommate has a cat and she is the sweetest cat ever. This past summer we moved into an apartment and the cat began peeing all over the stairs. This was extremely abnormal since she never did this in our old apartment and is often well behaved and relaxed. I know the peeing outside of the litter box can be caused by stress from the new environment, plus my roommate has been extremely inconsistent with cleaning the litter box. I made it very clear that I am worried about the cat, the unclean litter box's impact on the cat, the damages to the stairs, and that the cat pee smell is completely unbearable. Everyone that I bring over makes comments about the smell and my friends who are cat owners tell me that the smell will most likely never come out. Due to this, we had to get the carpet torn out of the stairs. The peeing stopped for a bit but then started again, except this time on the wood that was under the carpet. I begged my roommate to take her to the vet or find remedies to help the cat to stop peeing on the stairs. My roommate then buys some UTI medicine online and says that's the most she can do. Also, I forgot to mention that we have tried every form of cleaner to get the cat pee out. It doesn't get rid of the smell, but it does conceal it for a day or two. With all of this being said, I am so stressed. I have tried everything to make it clear to my roommate that this cat needs medical attention and the cat pee smell is spreading all over the apartment.

when she sees that I have treats, she begins huffing and hissing and her eyes get huge and she lunges at me whenever I get my hand close enough to give her a treat. she often bites my hand as I try to offer her a treat. what's weird about this is that she does not exhibit this behavior with her regular food (which she does seem to love since she's very prompt about demanding her food and gets very excited when I'm filling her bowl) to the point where I can take food out of the bowl while she's eating and she doesn't even blink.

she was a stray and I imagine that that's why she has some food aggression - I just can't tell how to solve this. if I withhold a treat because she bit me she gets really agitated, but hardly any less agitated as she is after she eats one treat and expects another. honestly it scares me to give her treats because of how aggressive she can get.

Both are spayed. We took Banshee in because Trisk seems like she would benefit from some feline company, and Banshee was causing some behavioral problems when left alone during the day. We had hoped that Banshee would be a good playmate for Trisk, and Trisk would keep Banshee company when there weren't any humans in the house.

We brought her home about 3 weeks ago, and we have our house partitioned off into two sides using baby gates with a thick blanket draped over them. We unfortunately don't have any doors, as we live in a trailer. Trisk and Banshee have had minimal contact through the baby gate, and Trisk seems fine with Banshee, but Banshee is showing a lot of aggression towards Trisk. We regularly have to redirect her from trying to claw and growl at the baby gate, and over the past few days she's learned how to knock it over. Every time she does, she goes for Trisk, hissing and snarling. Trisk seems more confused than anything, and just runs to a safer spot and stares at her instead of trying to fight back. We always separate them as soon as we can when this happens, but Banshee has mauled my hand a few times now for that, and I don't know how to get her to understand that Trisk isn't a threat and leave her alone.

Trisk has met plenty of other cats from her time before we adopted her, as she was part of the local cat colony. She also adored our 18yo cat that we no longer have. Banshee, as far as I know, hasn't met any other cats besides her parents/siblings, but she loves dogs and people, and actively enjoys being picked up except when she's being aggressive towards Trisk. I've seen a lot of people recommend food rewards for being calm towards the other cat, but we haven't found any treats that Banshee is interested in. Neither cat is food aggressive, and they're fed on opposite sides of the house.

At this point, my partner and I plan on building a temporary door so that Banshee can no longer knock over the baby gates. However, that doesn't help the fact that she still seems to hate Trisk. Is there anything we can do to calm her down?

I adopted my cat two years ago from a Humane Society (she‚Äôs about 3.5 to 4 now, a short haired brown tabby). She was a stray for the first year of her life and heavily pregnant. When she was finally taken in, she was able to give birth safely and fostered for a few months before going to the Humane Society, where I found her. 

I first adopted her in a house in college, with four other girls, then moved to a house in a city with two of the same girls.  If it‚Äôs important, it was a year each in both of those houses. Unfortunately, because of the ruckus of city life (and we lived on busy streets), I was not able to let her go outside. 

I moved into a house with my boyfriend 2 months ago in a very quiet neighborhood, but the thing is there is a pack of coyotes that live in the area that are known to steal and kill cats. I would love to make her an indoor/outdoor cat but I just don‚Äôt want to lose her to the coyotes outside. We have seen them multiple times in the neighborhood and many times 50 feet in front of our house. We also plan to be here for a few years, if not longer, so she won‚Äôt be moved around any time soon.

My dilemma is that she‚Äôs constantly wanting to be outside, more so than the other two houses she was in. She‚Äôs scratching at the door, she‚Äôs scratching at windows, dramatically meowing all the time and leading us to the doors. I try to put her on the leash and walk her outside on it so she can get some outdoor time, but I can‚Äôt do it all the time every day like she wants. 

She also just sits there in the grass and eats the grass or sits on the sidewalk and just watches the birds. She has full access to all the windows in the house, where she just watching the birds and outside. I took her outside today, and it was the first time she came across the other neighborhood cat. The other cat was fine, just seemed a bit curious. She, however, puffed up, and started hissing, and was really apprehensive. She‚Äôs usually fine with other cats, mostly apathetic, but this time she was a real jerk. 

I asked the neighbor how he handles his cat being outside, and he said he‚Äôs had no problem with it. He tends to stay around the house and even chases off certain raccoons.

My heart breaks writing this.

I have three cats, all indoors only. In 2018, when two of the cats were 8(Female) and 7(Male), we adopted an 8 week old kitten(Male). No one at the adoption agency consulted us about the age gap between our cats potentially causing aggression and issues (We later learned from a vet that the recommended age gap for cats is only 2 years).

After a three week isolation period, the cats met face to face, and aside from typical kitten energy occasionally spooking the older cats, they seemed to get along well.

When the kitten turned 1 year old, we moved to a home, doubling our square footage. Overtime, the kitten seemed to become more aggressive to the older cats.

It is now to the point where the other cats will hiss and run away from the kitten, as he will attack them randomly, and we're not talking a play fight, we're talking a fight fight. It's very clear that he may need to be a solo cat, as he has become very territorial.

She‚Äôs never had an issue with her litter box, pretty good temperament, and after a vet appointment, is known to be in perfect health. I posted on here when I first got her to ask for general advice, and I‚Äôve followed it. The only problem is that she will not stop tearing up the carpet.

I grew up in a house with carpet with three cats, two of which came to us declawed, one of which we got as a kitten and were able to keep her claws. In all the years I had them, they never had issues with clawing up the carpet. Ever since I adopted my new cat, the carpet on the inside of my bedroom door has been torn up day and night. She‚Äôs kept inside my room when I sleep, or when no one else is home, but aside from that, usually has free roam of the house.

At first, I thought it was the scratching post. Bought her a new post that she took to immediately, and loves to scratch. 

She kept scratching the carpet, so I got a horizontal scratching post that I fixed to the door. Came home to the post ripped off of the door and the carpet torn up to the floorboards. 

Sprayed a dose of feliway before I left, and came back to more shredded carpet. Sprayed about three doses, and still, more carpet that she‚Äôs torn up.

I caved and got one of the plastic mats that fix to the carpet, and it worked for about a week before she started tearing up the carpet around the border of the mat.

I‚Äôm sitting with her right now in my room, in front of my door, and she keeps hopping around my legs to tear at the carpet as if I‚Äôm not here.

I‚Äôm at my breaking point with her. I can‚Äôt leave her alone to go to class without worrying about how much carpet she‚Äôs ripping up while I‚Äôm gone.

I have one 4-year-old female cat. I have been looking into automatic feeders because of upcoming travel, and so I can establish a set routine for her. I feed her a small amount at a time, but more frequently because she has a problem with eating too fast, so I am hoping to find a feeder with small portions but more meal times to help with that. 

She has a more independent personality, so feeding and playtime are when I feel that I actually bond with her. The only thing I'm worried about with the automatic feeder is that she will lose that bond with me because I will no longer be the direct food source. 

I have researched a little about automatic, microchip, and smart feeders, and found some pretty good brands like PetLibro and Dogness. I am currently looking for something reliable, reasonably priced, and has a way of tracking meal times (like a log) so I can refer to them later.

Backstory: 

About a month ago I adopted Cookie Dough, a rescue kitten who is about 6 months old according to the vets. I already have a cat called Milkyway who is 2 years old. They're both female and spayed.

It took about a week for them to warm up to each other and Milky seemed to really enjoy Cookie's presence. I've had Milky since she was a few weeks old and safe for some visits elsewhere she has been an only child so far. So having a little playmate to actually play catch with was great for her. It was clearly playful, since they reversed roles a lot and never gave any signs of distress.

Cookie is clearly traumatized from her time as a stray and took (and is still taking) time to warm up to me. By now Cookie clearly adores both of us - she wants to be around us every waking and sleeping minute, napping on my legs and always coming over to see what Milky is up to.

Problem:

Milky seems to be starting to have regrets. She's withdrawing more from us, spending more time in my roommate's room (when she rarely left my side before). It doesn't help that when she comes over to ask for play or snuggles, Cookie wants to know what's up and engage with her. I see Milky rejecting Cookie more, smacking her away when she comes close and yesterday we even had a brief, tense staredown. I broke it up by redirecting their attention, but that spooked me.

I assume that the novelty has worn off and Milkyway wishes she could return to her old routine by now. I notice this in how she has picked some old behavior back up, like begging me for play even when Cookie is zooming in the background. Sometimes she approaches me and looks downright disappointed to see Cookie around.

Is this something I need to worry about? How can I make this easier for her? Do any of you have experience with this kind of reaction and can tell me how long it might last?

I miss my Milkybaby, especially when she stays away almost all day.

What I'm already trying:

I gently ward Cookie off when Milkyway comes to cuddle with me. It does not give her enough calm to continue for long though.

I check up on Milky sometimes, just seeking her out and asking her if she's okay. Petting her a little if she seems fine with it.

I try to engage both of them in play at the same time. For example, I throw something for Milkyway, then practice a trick with Cookie. When Milky comes back, I throw something for her again.

I try to make sure they never have to compete for resources, especially food and snacks. Both of them are pretty foodmotivated, so I do my best to always provide enough and distribute it enough that no tension arises.

And I've bought a pheromone diffuser that should be effective on the whole apartment. I already used those pheromones for the introduction and that seemed to help them.",CatAdvice,"2yo cat seems to get sick of 6mo kitten, what do?",

1668360925,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I‚Äôm 22F, and recently became the owner of a 12-week-old ragdoll kitten. 

I am not a first-time cat owner but technically I am since living on my own away from home! I live with my friend who also has some experience owning cats with her family. 

I did some research into the best cat breeds to keep indoors as we live in a city on a busy street, and recently purchased a 12-week-old rag doll girl kitten, she‚Äôs very well-behaved, purrs constantly and sleeps all day pretty much - but I worry that being indoors won‚Äôt be enough for her! She has bursts of energy where she tries to nibble plants and wires and scratch things but so far I have been around to redirect and distract her with toys - I just worry about when I‚Äôm not. I also worry the location of my flat is too noisy for her, although she seems ok. I live above a busy, noisy shop also, which might not be ideal. 

Our flat isn‚Äôt tiny but we don‚Äôt have a garden and will have to keep all the windows closed at all times in case she gets out. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs normal to feel this way but I‚Äôm incredibly anxious about leaving her alone, and just owning a cat in general.  

I work part-time, around 3-4 8-hour shifts a week and am also a student as is my flatmate. I did consider this before getting her but my flatmate and I both concluded there is almost always one of us at home within a 4-hour window at the very least. 

It is only day 3 now and I‚Äôve only left her alone once for just under an hour - she seemed ok, but she was asleep. when she‚Äôs awake and I leave the room she cries, which worries me even more about leaving her alone! I‚Äôve cat-proofed the flat as much as possible but I‚Äôm worried about things falling on her etc if she plays with them. I also plan on getting netting for the windows just in case. 

She has food and water out in the rooms she has access to (currently only my room and the living room/kitchen area), and a cat tree in the living room. When I go out I shut my bedroom door just to confine her to one area and minimise any potential damage! I hope this is ok? I‚Äôm not sure if this is irrational but we have one of those induction hob things that stays hot for a while after you use it and I‚Äôm worried about her jumping on it (she hasn‚Äôt yet even jumped on the counter), also jumping around and getting stuck somewhere she can‚Äôt get out and consuming plants she‚Äôs not supposed to, I‚Äôve put them all up high and out of reach but I‚Äôm still paranoid. This was never a problem with my other cats so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking things! 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve taken on more than I can cope with or if these anxieties will ease over time. I‚Äôm terrified to actually go to work and leave her alone properly, I couldn‚Äôt relax at all just going to the shops! 

I do also feel slightly guilty about her having no access to the outside and no other cats to play with. The only reason I was able to purchase such a lovely cat was that I inherited just enough money from my grandmother passing away to invest in a cat, which I‚Äôve wanted for a while, and she loved cats so it just felt right. However, I am stressing about not being a good enough home for her. I know it‚Äôs only been a few days but I haven‚Äôt really been able to relax, the first night I had her I didn‚Äôt really sleep because every time she would get up and walk around I‚Äôd bolt up to check on her. I‚Äôm being hyper-vigilant but I‚Äôm paranoid about accidentally leaving a window open, the stove on, a door open, a knife or something she shouldn‚Äôt eat on the counter etc. is this normal and if so, does the constant pet paranoia go away? 

I am fortunate enough to have the safety net of my mum, who is desperate to have her, we have had some pet and human losses over the past year that has affected us all, but especially my mum and she misses a small fluffy thing to cuddle, in her words. The cat they have now is much more aloof whereas this kitten never leaves my side and is much more of a lap cat, I know they‚Äôd love and mutually benefit from each other‚Äôs company. However, my dad isn‚Äôt so keen. They live somewhat near me but in a much safer area where she would have another cat to play with, access to the outside and a much larger indoor area too. My parents are also almost always home as they WFH, unlike me. My mum is ready to take her in a heartbeat but I would almost feel embarrassed and ashamed about taking on such a responsibility and not being able to handle it, but I also just want what‚Äôs best for the cat - which is what‚Äôs giving me such anxiety! In theory, I would plan to take her back when I am no longer a student and/or move to somewhere with a garden. 

I just worry I‚Äôve bitten off more than I can chew. When I think about my parents temporarily (when I say temporary I mean a over a year, so she won‚Äôt be going back and forth much) adopting her it brings me a great sense of relief if I‚Äôm honest, and I‚Äôd see her frequently. I might be overthinking it all as it is early days and she is only 12 weeks so she‚Äôs bound to calm down a bit and it should get easier, but since I‚Äôve had her in my care I have an almost constant sense of anxiety. Also just as a side note, another reason why I am even considering giving her to my parents is that my having a cat is that it pretty much eliminates the possibility of my boyfriend having his dog over to the flat that he shares with an ex, which is a shame.

Since last week (November 8), I started bottle-feeding her with both gruel and formula milk. I've tried training her to jump on her plate (hopefully to atleast smell the food) but she would just run around it. I also tried putting some of the wet food directly to her mouth to which she would try to taste and munch, but never on her own volition. Since it's been 5 days since her first taste of gruel, I tried putting the mix again on the plate in small amounts. She started licking some of it on her own, but not all. I tried placing the leftovers on her spoon and she would sloppily lick it, but then again, not all. So I guess, my question is, is our pacing normal? Or are we doing the weaning process too slowly? I'm scared of forcing her to feed because she might develop some aversion to her wet food if I do. Also, do you have other ideas or techniques that you could share to us?

As for the gruel mixture (the one on her bottle), I usually just mix 1/2 tbsp of her milk to 2 1/2 tbsp of water, then to 1 1/2 tbsp of wet food (Royal Canin Mother and Baby Cat starter food). As for the one on her plate, I usually mix 1.5L of her gruel and a small amount of wet food for thicker consistency (when I relied solely on her pre-made gruel mixture, she almost inhaled the milk so I was afraid to make the consistency thinner because she might aspirate).",CatAdvice,How long does the weaning process usually last?,

Eventually, that developed into a few scratches in the air over each side of her dish, eventually turning to one or two scratches on the rim of the bowl or nearby desk. We talked to one of the women from the rescue and she said that her cat did it too and that she was just being dramatic.

We have a new cat tree thing near their food that has scratching posts as every post, but they don't use it at all. She does have other things that she sharpens her claws on though, so I don't think that's the issue here. I'm not sure how to stop this behavior, largely because I don't know why she's doing it. I tried putting  wash cloths near the food dish in hopes that she would cover her food with them and be satisfied, but she hasn't touched them.

His name is ButtButt, he‚Äôs 8 years old,  I‚Äôve had him for 7 years, and he likes me to tell him what a good EaterButt he is when he‚Äôs eating. 

However, this has now evolved to him only eating his snackies while I‚Äôm bent way over, reaching under his undercarriage and rubbing his front armpits/chest and upper tummy while I both talk to him the entire time and/or sing to him while I do said undercarriage rubbing. 

As soon as I stop and start walking away then he‚Äôll stop eating and wander away. So just to be clear, it‚Äôs only with his snackies, my participation is not necessary during him eating anything else and he‚Äôs definitely not underfed, he‚Äôs got a little bit of chonk on him. 

How do I break it to my cat that him eating and enjoying his snackies does not need to be a two person event?

She also occasionally chases me around the house and playfully bites and swipes my legs. I don't think either of these things are actual aggression, I suspect she may need more play. The trouble I'm having is that she seems to get bored quickly when I play with her. I use a laser toy to get her very excited then I switch to a piece of string on a stick which she loves. I try to make her run as much as possible and climb as much as possible during the play sessions but she gets bored quite quickly. I have tried to use different toys with her but she is only interested in the laser and the string. I tried to tie a bird toy to the string but she wasn't interested. I would like for her to be able to properly bite and kick and ""kill"" what she ""hunts"" when we play but she can't do that with the laser or the string really. We also sometimes play hide and seek where I hide and poke my head out to let her see me then she runs to me and catches me (doesnt swipe or bite me during this). She enjoys this but my house is small so she gets bored quickly with this too. 


She's an indoor only cat, she can look out windows all day and I leave the back door open so she can look into the garden while I'm home, when I go to work and when I sleep I leave puzzle feeders out for her.

i recently (3 weeks ago) made the decision to get a kitten for a variety of reasons, two of them being so that kiwi can have a playmate and some company since he‚Äôs very playful, and also in the hopes that having a more sociable cat around might help his anxiety a bit in the long run.

the only thing is that kiwi is wayyy less vocal with me than he used to be. he still meows at me from time to time and makes a lot of smaller meows and trilling noises with fig but it‚Äôs nowhere near as much as it was before. i‚Äôm not really seeing any other behavioral changes and he seems to enjoy fig‚Äôs presence and i show him plenty of affection so he doesn‚Äôt get jealous. i have a theory that maybe some of his meowing from before was out of loneliness and so less meowing now is actually a good thing, but the paranoid cat mom in me just wants some other opinions!

We‚Äôve tried many things. Getting a new litter box. Using pet repellent. Blocking off the area where he poops on the carpet but that also didn‚Äôt work. Moving his litter box to the place he poops. I even picked up his poop and placed it in the litter box to see if that would work by redirecting the scent, but of course, that didn‚Äôt work.

This one vet recommended pheromones, but I don‚Äôt wanna waste money because I feel like it‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit if the other things didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm running out of options at this point, and I love my family cat, but our basement is completely destroyed and smells like shit, and they‚Äôre more fed up than I am and my parents have made me the ‚Äúexecutive poop picker upper.‚Äù I have to pick up multiple piles of a poop every other day, and I don‚Äôt know how long this is going to go on for. 

I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs feline dementia since the urinary blockage thing has been resolved given he‚Äôs super healthy otherwise now for his age.

Where do I go from here? Let him keep pooping how he has been until he dies? I don‚Äôt want him to die, and i think he has a few more years in him given his condition and energy. But my parents and I suspect he may be peeing outside the litter box, but I can‚Äôt smell anything nor can my parents. 

Any other recommendations?",CatAdvice,My healthy 18 year old cat still won‚Äôt stop pooping outside litter box after recovering from a urinary blockage.,

Just for inventory, Cletus has three scratch pads horizontal, and three that are vertical. He has one of those dish games that have the ball stuck in it so he can wack it around in a circle, a cat tower looking out a window. Two windows that have furniture underneath so he can look out those too. We play one-on-one with fetch (nurf bullets of all things hehe) for about an hour a day (I haven't found any other one-on-one activities he likes ) and he likes to play with pencils (just wacking them around not biting)

The thing is, my house is small, and when he gets the zooms, the man he is on it haha. He is running up the walls (there are scratch marks, and I'm worried il have to paint the whole house due to it being a rental) He is jumping on counters and knocking things over, including his feeding dish. I have a dog so I put Cletus' food on the table so he can eat it without worrying about Cassie ( my dog) eating it but now he is batting it on the ground. 

I think he is bored because he is jumping on surfaces and breaking a lot of things, but this is always when I'm at work ( so not sure if he is bored or just curious and clumsy). I've put double-sided sticky tape on all door frames to deter scratching which has worked....but I'm scared it will ruin my furniture if I put it on there.

1668279603,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone!
I have had my resident cat (10yr female) for about 2 years, she was fostered with several other cats when we adopted her, so has lived with cats before but it has been 2 years since then.
2 months ago we made the decision to adopt another cat (2ish yr  male). He has also lived with other cats before and no concerns with him.


So we brought him home and to my knowledge we followed Jackson Galaxy to a T. Scent swapped, site swapped, other side of the door feeding until they were consistently eating beside each other no hissing. Moved on to eat, play, love. We know we've got a bit of an age and energy gap so we play with the new cat, and resident cat (and she gets lots of pets when she's loafing, same as before). We also play/treat both in new cat's basecamp and rest of the house to balance out territorial business.


Here's where I'm not sure if it's going wrong and if anyone has experience with something similar. They're fine 80% of the time, sleeping in the same room, passing in hallways, scrambling with zoomies past the other. Then every so often my resident cat just gets weird. She'll find an ambush spot on the stairs or something and go to chase/swat the new cat (doesn't look playful, her eyes will be dilated and ears back). Sometimes she'll be rolling over onto her back, in front of the new cat, and slow blinking at him, and then she'll randomly flip her top and chase/swat him away when it doesn't look like he's even moved or there's been some other noise to startle her. 


So Reddit, what do you think? Does this kind of behavior mellow out? Have we moved too fast somewhere along Jackson galaxy's advice? Do we keep doing what we're doing?


Other info:
- Resident cat had her yearly vet visit a couple weeks ago and clean bill of health
- haven't had any litterbox issues
- still separated overnight
- when I talk about the behaviour mellowing out I'd like to clarify that when we see my resident cat setting up an ambush we redirect her and try to get her playing and keep the new cat occupied away from ambush zone

Today was the first day letting them be in the same room together and it went really well - they had a good sniff of each other, and eventually they both settled down and started bathing, napping, etc. I guess I let it go on a bit too much though. I was sitting on the bed with new cat, when old cat decided to jump on too. Old cat looked happy to relax, but when new cat noticed her she charged and it led to a full blown fight. I quickly shoved pillows between them to break it up. Now I have them in separate rooms again and they both seem pretty happy, but what should I do to prevent this in the future?

1668240832,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone. So I have a bit of a dilemma, or I guess more so just a situation I‚Äôd like some advice on and help in working out some potential road bumps. My (22f) boyfriend (23m) of five years and I have been renting apartments together for about three and a half years. In that time we have managed to accumulate two wonderful cats, and similar to all of you, I love them so incredibly much. 
We currently live in a city where rent is extremely high, and honestly it can be kind of hard sometimes. I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre living just slightly above paycheck to paycheck. 

Anyways, my grandparents, who currently live on the farm they raised me on, have generously invited the four of us to come and stay with them and help them around the property for a few years while saving up money to potentially buy our own house. As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine if you‚Äôve ever been poor, this sounds fucking awesome. My grandparents would not be charging us rent, just things like helping with groceries and electricity. 
However, I‚Äôm concerned for my cats. Firstly, my grandparents have an utterly massive Labrador named Jack. I‚Äôm talking 140 pounds. He‚Äôs nice, but cats are small, and even accidentally he could potentially kill them. He mainly stays downstairs, but I can‚Äôt guarantee always. Not to mention the onslaught of wildlife outdoors in the rural area that would make them into lunch. 
One of my cats, Pumpkin, is about 8 years old and would have no issue staying in what would become our bedroom (which is pretty large). But my younger girl, Mochi, can sometimes be a bit adventurous, and I honestly just feel completely petrified at the idea of her somehow getting out and coming face to face with Jack (who again, isn‚Äôt violent, just a unit), or God forbid getting outside. 

This would be a life changing opportunity, and if we could stick it out a year or two and save our incomes we could likely get together a down payment for a house. But nothing is really more important to me right now than my cats well-being. 

Could I make them happy living in that one room? Could I effectively keep them in there, safe? Does this seem ridiculous? 
I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, I‚Äôm just trying to really fill in the details. Does anyone have any advice? I‚Äôm feeling so conflicted. 

I have some ideas. Like making the closet into an area just for them, cat shelves, tall trees for them, baby gate at the door, self cleaning litter box to keep the small area clean‚Ä¶ but would it be enough? Any help would be amazing.",CatAdvice,"Two cats, two people, one room",

1668238739,self.CatAdvice,True,"Several months ago I introduced a new cat (F) into the household that was very cat reactive. I won‚Äôt use the word aggressive because she reacts out of fear and up until very recently she didn‚Äôt seem to want to start fights, just avoid them. She was very suspicious of my previous two cats (M + F) and growled and hissed anytime she would see them for weeks, but we slowly got to a place that they coexisted.  


We‚Äôre now at a place where they coexist a majority of the time. She‚Äôs even starting to sleep near the male who is more tolerant of her. The other female wants nothing to do with her. It feels like she ‚Äúburned a bridge‚Äù and now she won‚Äôt let her redeem herself. She growls when she gets too close or seems too interested in her.

I‚Äôm a new cat owner. I adopted a 3y old black male cat who weights around 12.5lbs and is fairly long about a month ago. The foster parent I got him from was feeding him two 3oz servings of fancy feast tuna and about 1 cup of kibble. 

I‚Äôve kept up the portions but I‚Äôve switched his wet food to the wellness brand. He had some loose stools on fancy feast so I figured it wasn‚Äôt the best option for him.

I feed him two 3oz wellness chicken herring meals‚Äîthe first around 11am and the second around 7pm. I then have an auto feeder that feeds him a little less than 1/4 cup of kibble at 9am, 2:30pm, 9pm, and 12am. He seems like he is a healthy weight but I want to make sure that I‚Äôm neither over feeding him nor under feeding him. As a side note, he‚Äôs fairly active and plays with his toys twice a day for a good 10 minutes. He also uses his water fountain throughout the day. Lastly, he will not finish kibble if he‚Äôs full, so he grazes on it rather than finishes the entire thing if he‚Äôs not that hungry.

Some changes in our lives (that I don‚Äôt know is necessarily relevant): she has been sick for quite some time. She started coughing two years ago and every time I brought it up to the vet she dismissed it. The first time my partner brought her in, they finally did tests and found out she has a lung condition, as well as asthma. She has been on steroids for about a week now and she has stopped coughing. For me, I got Covid 3 months ago which triggered insulin resistance and my blood sugar stayed above 300 for a while (even when fasting). At that time both of my cats were attentive and I knew the reason why. Now my sugars are under control and things went back to normal. The only other thing is the fact that I‚Äôm on antibiotics because one of them scratched me and caused an abscess that I had drained the day this all started.

Recently my wife and I had to move back in with family. We have 4 cats all ages 6-2. We thankfully had found someone to foster them long term until we were able to move back out, unfortunately today our foster told us that they no longer foster our cats so in now we're weighing our options. 

Now on to the main point, my thoughts were to build a cation type enclosure for our 4 cats in our families back yard (they don't want them in the house). All 4 of them have been indoor cats their whole lives and have almost no experience being outdoors. To keep them safe I felt like an enclosure with little individual houses/boxes would work. 

My wife's worry is that since it's starting to get colder as winter gets closer that they'll get too cold.

Before picking her up, she was already spayed, vaccinated, litter trained, and is very well-socialized and outgoing. She‚Äôs amazing and everything I‚Äôve ever dreamed of.

1668227492,self.CatAdvice,True,"So me and hubby saved a cat from getting ran over a few months ago (I mean this dummy of a kitten was literally running TOWARDS oncoming traffic)and at first he was very distant and scared of us but now he's more comfortable with being around us and even let's us pick him up (sometimes). We do have a few problems tho. For starters we can't decide on what the best food for him is (both dry &amp; wet), we also don't know how often to feed him, at the moment we usually feed him whenever one of us first wakes up, then we either take food away and give it back to him after a couple of hours at a time or we leave it out for him all day and by the middle of the day he's eaten all of it and is hungry again. Another issue were having is training him to not bite/scratch us when we pet/play with him, it's getting a little too annoying/painful to even try to play with him ourselves because he sees our hands and feet as toys...which use to be cute, but now it just hurts. Another issue is that hubby has 2 pet birds that are always in their cage, but ever since we brought our fur baby home, he had tried to get to the birds at every opportunity, it was so bad that we ended up having to move the birds to the high ground so that he can't reach them. Another issue is that whenever we try to eat some food out in the open, he'll try his damnest to sniff, lick, and/or straight up walk on our food, which is cute, until you remember where his mouth has been so you don't want him anywhere near something that you are about to consume. Our current solution to this is locking him in the Landry room until we're done eating (we're not proud of this, but it's the only way that we can eat in peace). How do you guys have the patience with your cats after they‚Äôve bittenand/or scratched you for the umpteenth time in a single day? And last but not least...is him being a hyperactive kitten.

1668216832,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I've had my boy coming up for 4 months he's almost 8 months old  He picked me as his person on the very first time I visited and did the same everytime I went to visit his breeder who is a family member I wanted to see if it was a one time thing before deciding if he was my boy. He had no interest in other visitors previously or after just me alone and everyone said wow he chose you you must be his human your the only person he will play and sit with and we've had others visiting several times like you. So I was given him freely knowing I'd give him a good loving home like my previous cats who passed due to age. On adoption day it was asked if I could also take his sister since no one was really wanting her and to keep them as a pair but last minute another family said they wanted her so she was given to them instead    During initial meetings with  the litter his sister was the one I originally was interested in possibly adopting but showed absalutely no interest in me wouldn't even come near me which I didn't mind she in my eyes wasn't the cat for me as I always allowed pets to show if they're interested in me and my family members it was the way I was taught when getting dogs and used the same rule for my current kitten. 

I've now been asked today after the family member was kicked out of the place they were staying if I and my husband could also take my boys sister too permanently firstly by the owner then by the breeder family member. Originally I said no to his owner for various reasons but mostly because this person has a history of on and off again pet ownership when they decide it's too difficult or causing arguments where they live it's how we ended up with our beloved dog 

My boy is amazing but he's a handful and is slowly starting to calm down and be a cuddly cat and has always been loving, he's also starting to follow commands like no, get down off things he isn't supposed to be on with no punishment just redirection or picking him up off something he isn't allowed on. The family member his  breeder called tonight basically begging us to take his sibling as unbeknownst to me   they're also getting ready and in the process of rehoming the 4 other siblings from the same litter she kept them not realizing the costs of owning that many kittens along with the parents. Added the costs of neutering/spaying 4 kittens along with the parents prompted the rehoming kittens on the breeders part.

Here's my biggest issues the girl has not been spayed, no vaccines that we know of, the owner admitted the kitten is incredibly play aggressive and destructive tearing up the place where they lived resulting in arguments over the cat and one of the various reasons they got kicked out.  When we visited previously she litrelly hid and hissed at everyone several timss whereas my boy is social and happily comes to greet new comers to my house he's only hissed once and that was at his breeder *not sure why they still adore him* as it was the first thing I did was ask friends and family to visit and get the cat used to other people coming in his environment.

My husband also is torn while we have the room for another cat and she was originally was supposed to live here as a pair I don't know how my boy will react to his sister after being a single cat for 4 months. Can they still live together as siblings even after being apart this long?  I understand she will need to be spayed ASAP if she does but I'm also worried about the behavior she's displayed while being owned by a family member they do like animals and in no way to be nasty usually have a history of not being able to handle the needs of pets they've owned. My boys a bit scratchy but not destructive except with his own toys through play and occasionally the sofa but he does stop when he's told to use his tree 

I could afford it at a stretch but we'd have to use a low cost spay clinic due to the sudden addition as we planned financially for my current boy making sure we had everything covered vs with the potential sudden rehoming of his sibling with us. We did the same for our dog but didn't plan on potentially owning a second kitten this soon.

I just adopted an 11 year old black tabby cat from a friend. From what I was told, she is an indoor cat and was having trouble getting along with other cats in the household. 

I've had cats in the past when I was a kid, but they were all outside cats. I live alone and have had no pets until this kitty came along.

I'm not working this week, so pretty much the routine is chill and watch some tv together, be on the computer while she walks around or chills in my lap or her raised bed next to me, play with toys/laser chase, eat treats, sleep in my bed with me when its night time.

I feel like she might really want to go outside. I have a fish pond and she likes to chill on the windowsill and watch them. I want to go out and do yard/pond work, but every time I go to the door, she comes, meows and waits for me to open the door so she can go outside. Maybe it's just because she knows there's fish out there? I'm not sure, but I've been staying inside with her because I feel bad. Her previous owner gave me a harness for outside but she absolutely hates it, she will NOT let me put it on her unless I really force it, which I don't want to do. One suggestion I've been given since she tends to follow me around a lot, (when she's not mad at me over the harness lol) was to just let her outside with nothing, but I'm nervous something could happen. 

Anyway, that's about it. I guess I'm mainly looking for advice or anything else I could do to make sure the cat is happy, engaged and comfortable, especially since it seems like she sleeps a lot...and on top of that, once I go back to work in a few days, she'll be alone for 8-10 hours each work day. I plan on getting her one or two of those multi-level cat towers to start.

He‚Äôs our world and he‚Äôs very mellow, he likes to play but only for short periods of time and lately we were feeling like we weren‚Äôt able to give enough attention so we wanted to get him a friend.

This kitten is way more energetic than the owner described, and for the first 5 days he was tolerating it but now he‚Äôs isolating, barely eating, and super grumpy. We did not introduce them correctly now that we‚Äôre looking into it, so we‚Äôve started to put him in my bf‚Äôs office (he always naps in there and can access the patio - he loves hanging out there) and he finally ate but its a process and he‚Äôs eating maybe once a day.

1668195998,self.CatAdvice,True,"This is something that I never thought I would think of doing in the 10 years I‚Äôve had my cat. Please be kind in the comments. Im in the consideration phase and haven‚Äôt made a decision.

My cat is over 10 years old. She‚Äôs been with me through many moves, and currently we full time RVing. Have been for some time.

Having her in my home has become extremely stressful and frustrating. I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying that she has been to a veterinarian and they informed me that she is in good health.

I‚Äôve always had a problem with her incessant meowing. Meowing for food, meowing at the door to go outside, meowing for no reason at all. It‚Äôs not a cute meow. It‚Äôs a very loud yowling meow that is like nails on a chalkboard. 

She has a routine for eating once in the morning and once at night, the same as her dog sister. It‚Äôs plenty of food maybe even too much as she is slightly overweight. I recently switched back to dry kibble because she stopped eating wet food all together. Originally switched wet food because she stopped eating her Acana kibble. At first she was really enjoying it and then suddenly she just completely stopped eating it. When I started giving her lower quality dry kibble, she proceeded to eat again and we haven‚Äôt had issues. I‚Äôve seen her not eat for 2 days before switching foods. 


She is outdoor/indoor, only because I feel awful about having her in a small space. She‚Äôll go outside for about 30 minutes then come back to the door to meow and get in. She‚Äôll even meow at the neighbors doors. Again this is not a cute meow. After letting her in she will be out the door after 15 minutes to go back outside. If I allowed it, she would do this all day.

I brush her every day, I play with her every day, but as soon as that‚Äôs done, she will go back to pacing around the house, alternating between meowing at her food bowl, meowing at the door, or just sitting in the middle of the room meowing for no reason.

She constantly tries to get on my chest when I‚Äôm laying down and even if I try to gently push her off, she will push back as hard as she can and I have to literally pick her up and put her down. As soon as she touches the ground she jumps back up. She doesn‚Äôt simply lay on my chest, she claws into my skin and is persistent about rubbing her nose and a half open mouth on me over and over. It‚Äôs really gross I hate it and it‚Äôs unhygienic. That‚Äôs all she wants to do when she‚Äôs trying to lay on my chest she has not interest in laying in my lap or anywhere else that‚Äôs easier for me. I‚Äôve tried. More and more she has been keeping me up all night long doing this.

If I‚Äôm sitting at my computer, she will jump up and sit on my keyboard. I try to allow her to stay on my desk in front of me where she likes to be but after a while, my back starts to ache, and I have to put her down. Usually she will immediately jump back up again after I put her down to try and resume the position and again persistently push herself into that space while I try to remove her. It‚Äôs pretty aggressive.

I have to be careful about how often I let her out because she tends to go through garbage out there and eats it then comes inside to vomit all over the carpet. I also make sure she isn‚Äôt out at night because there are some rough stray cats out there at night.

I also have breast reduction surgery coming up soon and I know that she‚Äôs going to constantly be trying to get on my chest while I‚Äôm healing. And that‚Äôs going to be painful. 

I love her, but I can‚Äôt help but think that she isn‚Äôt getting what she needs here. I can‚Äôt even figure out what it is that she needs because I‚Äôm giving her everything that I possibly can.  

I‚Äôm at my wits end and at a point where I‚Äôm actually considering rehoming her so that she can live out the rest of her life somewhere where she can do all the things that she wants to do.  I wish I could explain how aggressive she is when it comes to all of this. It‚Äôs not cute, it‚Äôs not endearing. It‚Äôs over the top and difficult to deal with. It is driving me insane.

Anyway, any perspective or tips for potentially rehoming her would be appreciated. If she did find a place to live I would like to potentially have updates on how she is and potentially contribute to costs to make sure she‚Äôs comfortable and happy.",CatAdvice,Considering re-homing my 10+ yo cat - help,

1668187102,self.CatAdvice,True,"Let me start by saying I love this little cat outside of the wee hours of the morning. She's sweet and friendly and doesn't make trouble outside of clawing up paper towels, which is easily dealt with.

But because my roommate does not let her into his room overnight, every night for the last few nights (I moved in about two weeks ago) around 2-4am she has started meowing outside my door loid enpugh for me to hear through earplugs, and sticking her paw under the gap between the door and the floor. I know the typical solution is to ignore this until she realizes she won't be rewarded - however, in doing so she wakes up MY cat, who sleeps in my bed at night. I play with him before bed so he normally sleeps through the night, but she wakes him and then they spend anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour batting playfully at each other under the door, after which my boy gets zoomies and keeps me up for another 15-20. So they both get rewarded for the bad behavior, and I get to listen to loud meowing and my door rattling until they settle.

The cats are friendly enough together, and around the same age (mine is 3yrs, his is 1yr) but they don't really play with each other yet, as my boy is still settling in and doesn't feel safe enough to play outside of my room yet.

My roommate is still new to cat ownership and doesn't play with her enough. I know the long term solution is to make him tire her out before bed or at least keep her in his room while he sleeps - but I don't want to sour things between us so soon by pestering him about his cat. But at this point this is affecting my quality of sleep, while he sleeps like a log and doesn't hear any of it even though he's right across the hall. I need a temporary solution until I can impress upon him the importance of engaging his cat.

I was thinking maybe a scat mat (NOT the electric kind, I'm not a monster) for in front of my door so at least, but if she learns to step over it, does anything exist that could keep them from pawing under the door?

1668180375,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all.

I have four animals, doggies Blue (13) and Macie (11), and kitties Bristol (6) and Phoenix (3). 

In the past 3 days, Bristol will not stop attacking Phoenix. She acts like she's scared of him, which she's never done. And Phoenix is an orange boy with one braincell, he's the absolute sweetest. He doesn't instigate anything and is not aggressive at all but for whatever reason she won't leave him alone. 

She is not showing aggression to the dogs. When not around him, she doesn't seem like she's in pain or doesn't feel well. I've checked her over for any injuries. They've lived together since Phoenix was a baby. There have been no changes within the house, like routines or moving things around. Everything is normal.

What I think is weird is also in the past 3 days, my dog Blue has been trying to hump Phoenix and also will not leave him alone. (Playfully, no aggression.) Blue has never done this with any animal. He has never shown any... I guess sexual behaviors. 

The cats are both indoor cats. But I'm wondering if Phoenix has gotten into something that's made him smell different or something like that. He and Bristol have their tifts but it never last this long. And the fact that Blue is all over him too is weird. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great! I hate having to keep the kitties separated because that means one has to be by themselves in a room (due to floor plan in the house, there is no other way to separate them, and I hate this.)

Recently my partner and I moved in together and both brought our respective pets to our new home together. Both cat and dog have never cohabited with the opposite species before.

Dog and cat have been living separately so to speak for the past 2 months with a pet gate separating them. The reason for the gate was firstly for their initial comfort but also my cat is on thyroid meds which I wouldnt want the dog to eat as kitty is a grazer. Secondly- lovely little dog, but does have the au de pupper and sheds like crazy so partner and I agreed he would be a downstairs dog.

My issue is that as kitty has gotten braver over the last two weeks, he is coming to the dog gate and literally boxing the dog through the bars, hissing, yowling, etc. Doggo gets excited and paws through the gate back at him, tail wagging, woofing in excitement.

I break them up as I dont want them to get hurt but is this a part of the adjustment process?

Last night the cat instigated his reign of terror 3 separate times and I caught him slinking back for a 4th before telling him off.

I dont expect them to be besties but am concerned if it continues to escalate in this manner that one or both will get hurt or stressed.

I keep them on my nightstand so I can grab them when I leave for school in the morning. But ive noticed they've been ending up on the floor, in my bed, and in the hallway.

1668137557,self.CatAdvice,True,"After reading about it, I believe my cat (2 years old, F) has single cat, or single kitten, syndrome. She was rescued by us at only five weeks old when she was rejected by her mother, and didn‚Äôt interact with any other cat until she was far older. 

Since she was a kitten she‚Äôs had problems with biting, and nothing seems to be able to stop the behaviour - not yelping, not walking away, not distracting her with toys, nothing. I believe that what would have prevented it is having a playmate who could bite back. She was never properly socialized, and I‚Äôm wondering if getting another cat could help change her behaviour. 

The problem is, she‚Äôs always been aggressive towards other cats any time she‚Äôs been around them. I worry that another cat would just cause long term stress if she‚Äôs already used to just being around myself and my roommates and not interacting with other cats. 

So my question is: can my chonically solitary cat‚Äôs single cat syndrome be solved with another cat? Or is it too late for her to be socialized?",CatAdvice,Single Cat Syndrome - Can it be resolved?,

My mom thinks since it's a smaller space I should one take one cat with me and leave the other one at home with them and she'll make sure to take good care of him. We have two cats, Finn (7m), and Evee (6f). My mom thinks I should just take Evee since she is more of my cat. Evee's favorite person is me and is not really interested in anyone else is our family. She hangs out in my bedroom most of the time and loves to sleep in my bed with me. She often follows me around the house or gets me to follow her. She licks me and just generally wants to be near me most of the time. She is scared of people she doesn't know and sometimes hides from Finn. Finn is super territorial and loud and rude. He's like a jerk in cat form. He has sprayed every couch in the house to claim it as his, despite being neutered. (My mom is concerned that if I take him with me too, he's going to do that again.) He likes to scream, a lot, and he can go for hours without taking a break. (My mom is also concerned he will bother roommates.) He likes to attack Evee, just like randomly or if he's hungry or bored. (She's kind of scared of him and hides from him at times and they just don't coexist in the same room for long periods of time well. Evee stays in my room and Finn is usually downstairs.) Also Finn claims all the cat toys and cat trees. We have 2 cat trees and essentially Finn is only one who uses them because he has decided they are his and Evee can't use them. Sometimes she'll go in the bottom cubby of one of the trees because Finn never goes in there because he's too big. Evee won't really play with toys if Finn is around because he takes them. She only plays in my room. 

BUT I feel like no one in my family really spends time with Finn like I do. He has long hair and needs to be brushed everyday so it doesn't get matted. I'm the one who feeds hims and brushes him and plays with him. No one else does. I want to bring him with me because I love him and I don't know if he'll get the attention he needs at home with my parents. He will miss me and Evee. (I don't think Evee will miss him though).

1668109326,self.CatAdvice,True,"My brother has an Almost 1 year old kitten/cat. When I first got the kitten for him it was fine. Had a sensitivity to a certain brand and went through couple weeks of having diarrhoea at 12 weeks. Was fine after we figured out what the issue was and was peeing and pooping normally in the litter tray until he turned 6 months old. 
My brother is very stressed out at the moment and hoping someone has an answer out there. The cat started off pooping outside the litter box frequently he didn‚Äôt completely abandon the box but he would feel comfortable pooping in that one spot like the bathroom. Used enzyme cleaner and everything but still he kept going there then we took the bathroom mat away and he stopped for a couple weeks then went back there even when there was no bathroom mat and began pooping there. This went on for a couple months, vet said he was fine and that it was behavioural. We then found out he had been pooping under the bed. Then he started peeing on the bathroom floor. We put a litter box in the bathroom but still he peed outside the box. So at this point he‚Äôs started pooping back in his box and peeing on the bathroom floor. We figured he needed to be neutered but we was also aware that it was a habit by now so we needed to break the habit. He got neutered and we confined him to a room with his litter box, showed him how to use it. We even put two litter boxes one for pee one for poop ( if that‚Äôs what the issue was) STILL he pees right outside the box but poops inside the box. So after maybe a month of re training him we let him out and he went and peed in 3 different spots. The litter is soft like sand but it can‚Äôt be the litter because he is using it for pooping. The vet said he is healthy but my brother will get a blood test done last resort. Let‚Äôs just say the blood test comes back fine? What then? What could this possibly be? What is wrong with him? We have tried calming diffusers, more than one litter box, open litter box, soft litter, litter training, enzyme cleaner each time, big enough litter box. Boxes are scooped daily. Tried different litter.  He gets 1/2 hours of playtime a day and everything he could possibly need as an indoor cat. He is the only cat. Surely it cannot be marking behaviour? He got neutered about 2 months ago. If it was a problem with his bladder then why would he start with pooping inappropriately first then peeing? We have also tried litter attract but it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs not abandoning his box he‚Äôs just peeing in other places but more and more frequently. Is there such a thing as cats having an overreactive bladder? So I don‚Äôt know if things like a urinalysis will be of any help. Nothing is working.

I have a super anxious cat. To the point that nothing I did worked. There was been a few post about it here. Long story short she was put on a very low dose of prozac. Two weeks after she is back to herself. 

I am hoping that maybe she can be in it for a year and I can slowly take her off of it. 

While she is doing better I do notice that she will be sleeping and if my fiance starts doing dishes she will get up immediately and make sure it is safe before going back to bed. None of my other 3 cats do this. I do notice that playing music or having some type of noise helps ""masks"" other sounds and she can sleep. This can be very simple sounds, doors opening, etc. And they can be happening far away from the room she is in, and she will still get a bit panicked.

Other than playing more with her (which I have been doing), what else can I do to help her ease her anxiety?

I have two lovely cats :) They‚Äôve been with me since the start of the pandemic and so they have only ever known home-life with me. That‚Äôs the norm for them - wake up, wake me up, play, eat, and enjoy :)

The problem is that I have to return to work in person next year. I am dreading and feeling anxious about how they will adjust because they‚Äôve been with me for about 2yrs 24/7 together basically all the time. I go out and they have been alone but not long. I realize that I‚Äôve spoiled them and worried about how they will adjust.

My question is, would it be better to have the two of them left home alone for the 9hr work day, and play with them plenty once I am home? Or should I bring them to my parents‚Äô daily so that they have a larger place to roam around and some human interaction? They‚Äôre still skittish of my parents and I have brought them over 1-2x a week for the past several weeks to get used to it. They‚Äôll follow me around wherever I go at my parents‚Äô home but they‚Äôll have a bit of fun exploring and climbing and jumping.

1668101041,self.CatAdvice,True,"About 10 months ago, we adopted an 8-month-old former feral from a rescue that keeps their available cats in a pet store. When I observed him and later met him in the common cat room, The Buddy ignored the other cats in the room in favor of me, and later, my husband. He adores humans, and anyone who enters our house is immediately greeted by The Buddy, who's never met a lap he didn't like. My husband and I don't get to travel together a lot, but the few times we have since adopting The Buddy, we had friends and neighbors look in on him three or four times a day, and we're told he was very starved for attention. He showed a little separation anxiety when we returned from a recent (short) trip to see my 81-year-old mom, and I wonder if he might like a friend when we (especially I) can't be around all day like we usually are (we both mostly work from home). 

I've found a 4-month-old female who loves cats more than she loves humans, and she's unbonded. The foster thinks she sounds like a good match for our cat, especially since she won't compete for our attention and she's a beta, so I'd been thinking we'd foster to adopt (I met her and she's so, so sweet). Per advice we read, I brought home a piece of her bedding; the Buddy sniffed it for a long time in a crouched position, then ran upstairs and starting patrolling the house. In doing some reading it sounds like the fact that he didn't hiss or avoid the smell is at least not a negative sign, but I'm super stressed about the introductions (I use Jackson Galaxy as my guide, so we're going with the separate-room plan) and the tension I saw in his body language.

For some background, my partner and I have a female cat, Luna, who we have had since 2019. She's about four years old. She's a tiny cat, is very friendly, but can be a bit timid. She used to live with an elderly (18 yr old) male cat and got along quite well with him before he passed. Back in June, we opted to adopt a second cat and brought home our new addition, Mochi. Mochi is a two year old female, who is extremely outgoing and friendly with people. She is also significantly larger than Luna. We did slow introductions for months, with each introduction stage successful, until they are unsupervised. When given the chance, Mochi stalks and charges at Luna, which ultimately terrifies her. Luna is not typically the aggressor, but will hiss whenever she notices signs of Mochi's incoming aggression. In thinking about it, it's really difficult for us to know if Mochi is instigating play, or actually aims to hurt Luna. Either way, Luna interprets all of her advances as a threat. It has been about 6 months since our initial adoption, and we have not been able to curb the stalking behavior. I have personally always owned cats, but have only introduced kittens to adult cats, and have not ever attempted to introduce two adult cats.

1668097710,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I have two babies, brother and sister, both neutered, age 7 years, they get along really well and love each other so much.

I am moving from Italy to the UK with my boyfriend and it's going to involve a long car trip. I've read loads about the best way to car travel with cats, but we are still uncertain about some details and what would be best for them. To be honest, I am really anxious because I want them to be as fine as possible.

To give a bit of background... They already moved twice, but each time it was just an hour drive. The first time was when I moved at my boyfriend's, then we stayed there for about a year; after that, the cats and I moved back with my mum but in a new house, and now after six months, we are going to join my boyfriend in the UK. They don't like moving, but the second move was better than the first one, they got used to the new place way faster. Instead, the second drive was a bit worse: they meowed all the time and Grey pissed himself. Between this two moves, we had to get them to a special vet for their passport, each drive back and forth was 30 mins, and going there Grey pissed and shit himself. The vet carrier is different than the ""move"" carrier, just to be clear. So, yes, Grey is the one that gets more stressed.

We found what we think would work best for them: staying in a carrier together (when they are together they are way more relaxed, even during a car travel), but they will have enough room to stay away from each other if they want to; I will sit in the back with them as we found that helps too; there is some cat music they particulary enjoy; we will use feliway too; and the vet prescribed us a relaxant. I am harness training them, and Grey is at a really good point, so maybe we will have also that option - I know some cats prefer to travel with the harness and leash on without being in the carrier, but I am not sure we will get to that point.

Our real dilemma - the reason of this post - is how to structure the drive itself. It is a 17 hr drive, with normal traffic and without considering pauses, so let's say 20. We are okay doing it in one go, and initially we thought it was maybe best for them - as they don't like new places generally - but now I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to stop for the night somewhere and do two shorter drives. I am afraid that in one go, they wouldn't use the litter and I don't want them to get an UTI.   
Grey just had struvite and calcium oxalate crystals one month ago, probably due to stress; he is totally fine now, he is taking a med (STIEN in Italy) to prevent it and they are also both eating the urinary care food. She had an UTI 2 years ago, non stress related. But you can see why I worry about this.

At about a year he started becoming affectionate. He would rub against your legs or hand, flop down and roll over to ask for belly rubs and you got to hear him purr a couple times a day anyway. He still wasn't like that all the time but you got enough of it. We used to pick him up all the time and while he didn't want to be held too long, he seemed content with it. Every once in a while he would purr a little while held, maybe knead on our arm a bit. I was happy with that.

But now, getting closer to two years, he's going back to preferring to be alone it seems. If he sees you, he'll raise his tail and you can pet his head a couple times and he clearly likes it. But no purrs, no flopping. If you pick him up, he goes stiff and will generally give a meow in protest within seconds. He seems FAR more prone right now to getting upset to the point of attacking. The only real times he seeks out affection now are when we go to the bathroom (he NEEDS to come in and he'll be all love-y for about 30 seconds) or when we go to bed he will come up between us, flop down and purr and be 100% affection. If we didn't have that, I'd be much more upset.

1668071746,self.CatAdvice,True,"I caught my 5-month-old kitten picking up one of his basic little mouse toys in his mouth and carrying it over to a small cardboard box. He puts the mouse in the box and then spends a while throwing it around in the said box, like he's trying to chase it within this small limited space. He goes completely crazy for it.

He has done this several times now and I'm really amused and puzzled!  
Does anyone have an idea of what would inspire him to do this?

My guess is that maybe he just finds more enjoyment in throwing the mouse around in a small space and he figured out how to achieve this game, but I wonder if there is any actual explanation for this!

1668059511,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 4.5 month old kitten two weeks ago. He is very sweet, cuddly, and energetic! I am having so many mixed feelings about him though. **TLDR at the bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

To start, the kitten has done nothing wrong. But some issues have come up. I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

1.  I have a 15 year old blind dog, and although the kitten seems to like him and is actually trying to rub against him, my dog is not liking it. Bubba has a very sweet temperament and does not have an aggressive bone in his body.  But he has severe separation anxiety, and I was hoping that another animal in the house would help, but it has actually made it worse. I though Bubba was scared at first, but it seems like he genuinely does not like the kitten. Him being blind also means that he can't see the kitten and his body language. We've had many instances with the kitten wanting to play with bubba, or even getting aggressive with bubba because he isn't paying attention to him. I can tell that bubba is getting increasingly stressed and is not liking our situation at all. I've had him since he was a puppy, and I know him well enough to say that him warming up to the kitten would take more than time. I honestly think that Bubba might be jealous or something...
2. Time is also another issue. I already knew that kitten would have a lot of energy, so I tried to prepare to be available to play with him for around four or five 15-30 minute increments throughout the day. But even after we are done playing, he seems to keep bouncing off the walls. During these times he also is attacking bubba out of excitement. He is so cute, and I enjoy playing with him sometimes, but most of the time it feels like a chore. As time goes on it is becoming harder and harder for me to enjoy playing with him and giving him attention... I feel so terrible saying that when he is so sweet and he can't help his energy level! 
3. I've noticed patchy rashes on my legs that appears to be contact dermatitis. I am very prone to skin allergies, so I take a morning and a night allergy medication and I have learned what causes my allergies so I only use skin products that I know I'm not allergic to. I noticed these rashes a couple days after getting the kitten, and I can't say for certain but I think I might be allergic to him... I haven't changed anything in my routine except for him. I'm really sad just thinking about the possibility that I am allergic.
4. This isn't fair to the kitten, and I don't really know why I'm adding this, but I have a lot of plants that I care about and I am so scared that he is either going to get sick from them or he is going to kill them. I am currently in the process of segregating most of them to one room and hanging the rest up high. But from what my friends have told me about cats, its that they will find a way to get up there if they are motivated enough. He has already managed to get on top of my fridge! I really can't give away or sell most of my plants since they are family heirlooms...

**TLDR: Overall the biggest reasons I am on the fence is because my blind senior dog seems to be really stressed and shows no signs of warming up, and I am developing skin rashes possibly because I am allergic to the kitten. I know that people say that time will tell, but I don't want to make the kitten grow more attached to us and have him suffer by taking him back to the shelter. But after doing a lot of research I am also worried about the kitten not finding a good home to adopt him. I just really don't know what to do. I keep thinking that our lives would be back to normal and be easy and calm again. But I feel so guilty for thinking that way. I want to believe that he would find a good home since he is so sweet and cuddly, but I have no way to know...**

&amp;#x200B;

*I am going to try to go to the doctor soon to try and see if I'm allergic to cats or maybe something else (liter maybe?). And if I'm not, and I decided to take the kitten back to the rescue, would it be stupid of me to try to adopt an older cat instead? I thought that a kitten would better adapt to our home, but now I'm thinking that maybe Bubba would warm up to an adult cat more? I don't know though. If anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice.*",CatAdvice,"I can't seem to make a decision regarding the kitten I adopted.

1668056670,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi!! First-time kitten owner here, adopted my 7 week old baby about a week ago! Struggling with a couple things and would love some advice:

1. he CONSTANTLY is play-attacking my hands and feet. Like, I can't even get up without him pouncing and his energy bursts last hours. I've always been trying to redirect his attention and hand him toys, but he still prefers my hands and feet. I've also tried letting out little yelps, but to no avail. How do I curb this habit? I've read that ""ignoring"" works, but what does that mean? just let him bite? 
2. I'm slightly discouraged by all the research I'm doing about single cats. It makes me feel like I'm gonna grow up with a lonely, aggressive cat no matter what I do unless I adopt a companion. Can I hear some success stories from someone about a single kitty who outgrew the biting kitten phase and is doing just fine? 
3. Theres been 3 occasions where he's done a short ""Hiss"" at me while playing. Is that normal? I don't know if I can classify it as a hiss but I don't know what else to call it

Anyhow, since the separation, my cat seems happier? Thrilled when I come home (zooms around the house and constantly flops for belly rubs), snuggles me 5x more, stays constantly near me, and has become so talkative! He happily trills as we play and purrs louder than ever before.

1668055572,self.CatAdvice,True,"Starting note: I actually have three cats, but the third (Harley) isn't super relevant here; she doesn't get along super great with either of my other two but she mostly ignores them so it's not a big deal.

This is about my other two cats - Asuka (female, 4, spayed, tuxedo) and Gawain (male, 4, neutered, white). Asuka has always had anxiety issues but they've skyrocketed since we adopted Gawain, to the point where she's sequestered herself to the second floor of our apartment and we've had to start feeding her separately because she won't come down even for food. 

Gawain was found on the streets with a number of injuries, sad and hurting, and immediately attached himself to us. We helped him recover. He has never been anything but sweet to Asuka; when she hisses at him he sits down and slow blinks at her. He tries to play with her occasionally, which she hates. If he dares to come anywhere near her she hisses, swats, scratches; when we're out of the house and can't separate them sometimes we'll come home to find he has a new scratch on his ear or nose.

Asuka was our first cat together; we've had her for almost her whole life. Feliway doesn't help. We've been considering taking her to the vet for possible anxiety medication because her anxiety levels around Gawain are just not rational. And she's hurting him, and that's hardly fair to him.

This has turned into a ramble - basically, I love both of these cats and they are both incredibly attached to us. Rehoming either is not an option. But the current situation is not fair to either of them and I'm not sure how to proceed outside of the aforementioned anxiety meds thing.

Yesterday I noticed him crouching strangely, but thought nothing of it, and today I got home to little drops of pee all around the room, with his litter box full of scattered little pees.

I WFH, which I thought would be good for pet ownership, but has almost made things worse with a cat who clearly has separation anxiety. She wants to be on me all day. The first few days, I allowed it, but she freaked out when bed time came and I closed my bedroom door/went to bed without her. Yowling most of the night ensued. After lots of reading, I implemented all the recommended changes, including creating a boundary of staying away from me while I‚Äôm working to build comfort with being alone, which she‚Äôs picked up on well. Things have improved a bit at night, but she still my yowls for about 45 minutes after I go into my room. I would normally be ok with this, but I live in an apartment complex and fear noise complaints coming. 

My question: should I try just letting her sleep with me? My big concern is that will mean she has relative access to me pretty much all day and it will only make her separation anxiety worse if I have to go into the office for the day or have to go away for a night.

1668029818,self.CatAdvice,True,"My wife and I just adopted a kitten that's somewhere between 2-3 weeks old (mother couldn't be found and it was crying in the rain) we've seen a vet and got some advice from them, but I still had some more questions.

Just to lay out her situation: We took her to a vet within 30 minutes of receiving her, the vet wiped her once and she let out so much that the vet was shocked, but said it seems she's starting to get it all out and she should be okay, but to come back if she has any stomach issues. She also received a dewormer.

She's been bottle fed the last 3 days (tomorrow is scheduled to be her first day on wet food + KMR formula mixed according to the vet) 

Her sleep situation is we have a walk in closet separate from any of our other animals, we have her in a box in there with a puppy pad and a fluffy blanket, so the ambient temperature is higher than the main house and she can stay warm.

Questions:

1) Her butt has been pretty red since that initial wiping at the vet (and following huge expel) - is this okay? It seems _less_ inflamed but I'm worried Im just inflaming it more when I wipe her.

2) For wiping her so she can go to the restroom, how long should we wipe? We've been trying to use baby wipes, are these okay? I bought cat wipes but they say ""not for internal use"" which worried me about wiping her with them.

I don't wanna wipe too long and inflame her even longer, but I also don't want her stuffed up cause I didn't do it right.

Our vet instructed us to do it once per meal, and so far she pees after every meal but doesn't poop most the time 
(maybe 1-2 times a day? sometimes in her box, even though she didnt go during a feeding, which requires cleaning everything out and remaking it)

3) When she cries for food, we feed her, and she'll usually drinks a lot which is good, but then she stops. 

She then starts sitting there crying, but if we give her the bottle back she maybe suckles a tiny bit then spits it out again. 

Holding her doesnt seem to help, and neither does letting her walk around a bit seemingly, if we put her back in her box and in the warm closet she'll cry MUCH louder and climb towards us until we close the door and let her cry herself out - she then falls asleep.

Is anything wrong with that? I can't find info on kittens in this age group crying beyond ""They cry for food"" but she doesn't want the food, so I'm just not sure what else to do but get her to sleep?

4) Is there anything stimulating we should be doing for her? 

Right now the process has been:
Wait until 3-4 hours has passed since last feeding, or she cries -&gt; Feed her until she stops accepting the bottle -&gt; try and let her walk around or climb on us a bit to work on her muscles and coordination -&gt; put her back in her box in the closet and let her sleep till next feeding or she cries again

Is there anyway we should be playing with her? or stimulating her? I want her to learn how to walk and play when she's supposed to, and she seems interested in walking around, but she's also uncoordinated and falls over a lot, and shakes when she holds herself up too long.

5) Her back legs/tail are kinda grimy, they feels wet most the time and have that sorta ""stiff"" feeling.

We kept Martini in a bedroom by herself when she first came over and still do bc of the issues we‚Äôre having. We did the Jackson Galaxy method of introduction. 

We‚Äôve gotten to a point where both cats can be in the same room together and things mostly go well. They can both sit on the couch in peace. They were even face to face the other day (although that ended with Martini hissing, but I believe she is scared of Peanut). We give them treats and play with Peanut (Martini is not very interested in toys). 

Here‚Äôs our issue - anytime Martini gets off of the couch and starts walking around/goes outside the bedroom to explore, Peanut stares her down and chases her. Martini runs to hide under another couch and will hiss and growl at Peanut. There has been swatting/hissing on both sides but so far no major fighting with fur flying/blood. 

I try to use treats or toys to distract Peanut when I see her staring Martini down but 9/10 times it doesn‚Äôt last long and she ends up chasing. We have tried calming treats and spray - that didn‚Äôt work. Currently trying a calming collar on Peanut but so far I haven‚Äôt seen a huge difference.

1668005237,self.CatAdvice,True,"TLDR: Outdoor boy cat is stressing out our formerly outdoor girl cat - should we adopt out the boy cat, or is there a better solution?

Some backstory: About six months ago, 5 kittens turned up in our backyard (2 boys, 3 girls). We successfully TNR‚Äôd all 5 babies, and have been feeding them twice daily ever since. The 2 boys and 1 of the girls have been extremely affectionate and accepting of human interaction since day one. 
About a month ago, one of the boys went missing and hasn‚Äôt returned. We think he was able to find a family that took him in with them and now he‚Äôs living the good life indoors. 
With one cat down, we began becoming very attached to these cats, the most being with the runt of the pack, one of the girls. The other boy was just as affectionate - they would come into our sun room every night for pets and snuggles. While they should be technically deemed feral cats, they never struck us as such, because they were so accepting of human touch and would come up to us with no hesitation. 
Our favorite, the runt girl, all of a sudden turned up with a scrape on her nose. This sent us into a tizzy and, in order to prevent her nose getting any worse, she was moved indoors with us. She‚Äôs now been to the vet, her nose is fully healed, and she‚Äôs a new member of our family. 
Since she has come inside to live with us, the remaining boy has begun yowling outdoors at night. He has scaled our house to get to our bedroom windowsill, and hangs from the screens on our window on our sunroom, all while meowing very loudly. It‚Äôs very distressing for both our cat and us. We thought perhaps they just missed each other, so we let him back into our sunroom so they could be together, but they didn‚Äôt show any interest in being together. It seems that he just wants to be inside with us as well - I‚Äôm not sure if the yowling is territorial or jealous.

My question is - do you think it would be okay at this point to try and adopt the boy out? Or would it cause more harm than good? I think he is destined for the indoor life and would be great at it. At this time we are not able to accommodate them both living inside with us. Or is there a different solution we should consider? Would no longer feeding them encourage to move on from our yard?

So as I mentioned, she's at the age where she's super into everything and still has that kitten energy. She'll get zoomies and run around the house, meowing like crazy, which is a good sign she needs to be played with. I work from home so I try to play with her fairly consistently, 2 times a day about 30-45 minutes per session with food immediately after. Lately though, I found she's been pretty uninterested with her wand and prefers a laser pointer.

I bought a retractable wand off Amazon and it came with a ton of attachments. I've also just buy her new ones whenever I see them so needless to say we have a ton to work with. I have feathers, worms, mice, and even a bee. And for a little bit, she'll love it. She'll stalk it, chase it, I let her catch it; usual stuff. But after maybe after 2-3 play sessions she'll just have no interest in it whatsoever. She'll just casually walk away and play with something else while I'm standing here, trying my hardest to convince her this is prey.

We also bought her a laser pointer toy, which both me and my girlfriend were a little skeptical at first. We've both heard it messes with cat's heads since they physically can't catch a dot so it might be frustrating for them. Originally I bought it as a tool, rather than a toy. Jackson Galaxy mentioned that it's good to ""wind-up"" cats to play with physical toys, which is what I'd try to do. I'd also use it as a redirection toy, something to take away her attention from something I don't want her to play with. But after being fed up with her not playing with the wand, I whipped out the laser pointer and got her to play for a solid session. She looked satisfied, was panting and purring, and like I said it was the most consistently engaged I've seen her play in a while. The thing is I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should continue to use the laser over wand. To put it bluntly I feel like I'm giving her the kitten playtime equivalent to crack, just feels extreme and I don't want her sense of play to be warped because of it.

My question is what alternatives to the wand that are still remote (cat on one end, me on the other) would you recommend? I think the message Friday's sending to me is that she's bored of the wand, but I know if supplementing it with kitty crack (laser pointer) is the right way to go.",CatAdvice,Kitten prefers laser pointer over wand,

We adjusted her to indoor life by slowly trusting her alone, and giving her lots of attention and letting her sleep during the day. Then we would keep her inside during work hours because it tends to get rainy in autumn. What made me realise she should be kept indoors fully though was aside from the fact we realised the places she'd go to were kind of filthy, we also caught her a few times nearly crawling inside the open window of those awful neighbours who almost got her killed (this became especially common the last week or so).

The first time we tried to keep her inside at night was in July, but she kept meowing/crying which made us relent and let her go outside. But last night was the first night she stayed inside 24 hours, and although she did meow a few times, she would usually after 5 minutes just move on and relax as if she didn't care anymore. I did stuff like play with her, allow her to climb and roam the apartment, as well as putting livestreams of birds and mice on the TV to help stimulate her. And I was able to sleep the whole night without any disturbance from her.

What I want to know is, is this good progress? I know some cats can get depressed or stressed staying inside whilst some cats can adjust absolutely fine, and I want to make sure she's happy and content.",CatAdvice,Trying to get stray cat to become indoor only - is this good progress?,

1667978295,self.CatAdvice,True,"We thought it would have been a good idea to get a new kitten (Oliver) to be a companion for my 10 years old cat (Sophie); we also have a big house which felt kinda empty, so this also played in our decision to adopt a kitten. We picked a cat of the opposite sex in hopes this would recude intial hostility. 
We are following ""introducing a new kitten"" protocols: Oliver has its own room for now where he sleeps and spends parts of the day. He's been here less than a week and I know it takes time, especially with a cat that has established routines and a certain character like Sophie - she is very quiet, likes to nap, while Oliver at 3 months old is a savage.
I would say it's not even going bad: when we are home and can supervise them, Sophie is always overseeing what he does as he plays and randomly runs around, the hissing and the growling on her part are tuning down as well and she is starting to relax a little (aka going back to sleep, sort of) if he doesn't get too close.
I'd like to add that this is what the vet told us to do - after the first 3-4 days where Oliver has stayed mostly in his room, where all of his needs are met of course, to let them interact and just let it sort itself out.

The doubt I have and the reason for me to ask for advice is this: whenever Oliver decides it's time to force socialization, he'll try to play with Sophie by hiding and doing little ambushes and following her around; Sophie responds to this by hissing and trotting away, pissed; she swatted at him only a couple times, no claws involved. Considering how she reacts, would you say this'll fix itself over time or do we need to change strategy? Most of all, is this too stressful for Sophie?

1667978022,self.CatAdvice,True,"Here's the story:

Last summer when it was warm one night I had the door open, and a kitten came into my house.  I didn't know whose it was but it looked healthy, so I gave it a little tuna and let it stay with me for awhile.  It left in the early am, a few weeks went by and then I saw it in my neighbor's window.  The window was closed but soon after they started leaving it open in the day so the cat could go outside.

After awhile he started popping up again occasionally at my place when I left my door open, usually just to say hi and walk around a bit.  Sometimes I give him treats, he isn't overweight and he's quite vocal when he wants one.  But I also noticed sometimes he'd be meowing outside my next door neighbor's door (not the cat owner) looking to get invited in by them as well.  Since I often leave my own door open for air flow, when I hear him meowing even if my door is shut I'll open it and see if he wants to come in.  He usually hangs out for awhile checking out the corners and nooks then leaves.

Lately he's been doing it a lot more often.  Last night it was pouring rain and barely above freezing.  I normally never see him in the evenings, I assumed he went home to his family and a warm bed.  But it was very late (after midnight) and he was meowing so miserably so I let him in to get warm.  He pretty much instantly jumped on my couch and nestled between my legs on top of my blanket, where he stayed until morning.  I left the door open for him even though it was cold, and he left just before dawn.

The next day I asked a different neighbor who said the cat gets left out every night.  He was at my door again tonight and much earlier, so once again I let him in and he jumped on the couch to purr and take a nap while nestled against me for warmth.  Now he's fast asleep in my armchair and I plan to give him a safe space to sleep out of the elements whenever he wants.

It clearly wants a nice place to be comfy at night, but is giving shelter to someone else's cat like the pet version of home wrecking?  I don't feel bad at all, if anything I think the owners are not doing a good job by forcing it outdoors especially in bad weather.

1667939815,self.CatAdvice,True,"Question about my 3.5 year old male cat

my spouse and I adopted a male cat in the beginning of 2020. He is the sweetest thing and we absolutely adore him. However, he does have a very odd habit and we are constantly wondering if this is normal. As we get ready to go to bed (our place is very small, only 500 ft.¬≤ so we are never going far from his usual resting place) no matter the time of day or night he will *run* in the room and begin howling very loudly. He will do this regardless if I‚Äôm taking a nap at 2 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon or if I‚Äôm getting to bed late at one in the morning‚Ä¶But anytime we start to settle down he will absolutely lose his mind. There is no stopping him either, we try to get him to settle, pet him, welcome him onto the bed, let him dig under the covers- he is relentless. It makes me sad because often we have to shut him out of the room because we can‚Äôt get him to stop and settle down. 
Luckily he doesn‚Äôt really mind being out of the room in the living room as his tree and toys are out there and he‚Äôll sleep usually until about 5 AM which then I will be woken up by his relentless howling again. 

At this time I try to let him in the room and get him on the bed and calm him down. And sporadically he will get up and howl again. He is a very verbal cat, sometimes to a point I can‚Äôt even believe. During normal hours of the day he is always talking which is much appreciated as he makes a great companion.. but we seriously cannot figure out why he is doing this when we start to wind down or how to make it stop. We need sleep!! 

A couple other things of note- he gets fed wet food every evening around 6/7 o‚Äôclock. We constantly have dry food out for him and he has multiple water locations in the house and two litter boxes. We have another male cat (6 years old) who is a great friend to our 3.5 year old cat- they get along great, cuddle, bathe each other, play.. never had any issues between the two of them after their initial meeting beginning of 2020.

The vet gave us a cone for his head but did not put it on for us, we tried to put it on but he practically backflips getting it off. It does not stay on for more than a minute. Is this needed? As the vet didn't put it on maybe it's just incase.. We also got no pain medication.

1667924465,self.CatAdvice,True,"Me and my girlfriend took in a kitten named Friday and she's a 5 month old tuxedo cat. She's currently at the teenager years and is running around our small apartment in bursts of energy. We play with her fairly consistently and try to make sure we follow the Cat Mojo method (Hunt, Catch, Kill, Eat, Groom, Sleep) and play with her before we feed her for about 30-45 minutes twice a day, once at 8:30am and once at 8:30pm. Like I said, we live in a pretty small, open-concept apartment and our bedroom is essentially just the attic of a 3 story building. Because of that, we don't have a proper door but rather a set of stairs. And that was all fine until we brought in a kitten. Like I said she's pretty energetic and loves to run around the apartment and get into everything, and this is doubled in the morning around 5am. Lately she's been a complete nuisance, getting into things she knows she's not supposed to, biting wires, scratching up the box spring, pretty much anything she can play with to wake us up. We think it has something to do with daylight savings time, as she'd usually do this around 6 when my girlfriend wakes up for work, but regardless it's pretty irritating and while I understand this is ""just a cat thing"", we'd like to work out some solutions here.

We were considering getting a baby gate and locking her out when she gets like this but as you can see, [the stairway](https://imgur.com/a/qtgAuB3) is pretty wide and there's tons of little nooks and crannies she can get around in. We have 2 other rooms with doors in them in the apartment, the office and bathroom but honestly I don't want to lock her in these rooms when she's misbehaving. That'll only get her to be afraid of me and I don't really want to sacrifice her trust for a few hours of sleep. so that's not really an option I'm willing to take.

1667878594,self.CatAdvice,True,"Ugh where do I even begin‚Ä¶ My husband and I have a 6 year old female cat. She‚Äôs super sweet and precious. However over the last year, she has begun to urinate relentlessly all over the house and it‚Äôs driving me insane.

This all began when I first got pregnant. She started peeing on our laundry randomly. I thought she had an UTI so I took her to the vet. The vet told us everything looked fine but gave us an antibiotic just incase. We saw no real improvement in the inappropriate urinating. She then started to pee on the carpets randomly. We thought maybe she didn‚Äôt like the box and/or liter she was using, so we changed those out - Didn‚Äôt help. I had husband start cleaning her boxes out twice a day - didn‚Äôt help. I thought maybe she needed more love and attention - didn‚Äôt help. We‚Äôve been just fighting random inappropriate urination by cleaning with enzyme cleaner assuming it was a behavioral issue due to her sensing my new pregnancy hormones, hoping it would eventually pass. The vet said she must be stressed about something causing the behavior since it would come and go. No medical issues have been identified. 

Well since baby has been born 5 months ago, she‚Äôs gotten relentless about it. She‚Äôs refusing to use her liter box all together. Our son is extremely colicky ( he has a lot of food allergies that we‚Äôve been discovering/removing from his diet) and spends a great deal of time screaming. Hubs &amp; I are pretty certain that kitty isn‚Äôt adjusting to baby and is incredibly anxious from his screaming. She‚Äôs ruined our upstairs carpet, some hardwood floors, countless pairs of shoes/bags/clothes. I have to clean the bathtubs out daily because she now is pooping in there. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind locations or textures of where she is going. She hasn‚Äôt soiled anything of the baby‚Äôs yet but if she does, that will likely push it overboard. We‚Äôve tried anxiety meds, allowing her to go outside, checking for other medical issues. The vet told us as she acclimates it should stop, but it isn‚Äôt getting any better - it keeps getting worse. I‚Äôm at a 100% loss on how to make this transition easier for her. 

This new Mom is growing exhausted of constantly cleaning up cat pee and poop.  Husband is down to two pairs of shoes after her ruining all of his other ones. Babe is starting to show signs of wanting to crawl - which terrifies me that he‚Äôll accidentally find one of her random spots. 

How do I help her transition &amp; calm down so she can use her liter box again? I feel like I‚Äôm running out if options...

However I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs damn near impossible to rehome a cat with urination problems‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine taking her to a shelter and something terrible happening to her. I‚Äôve never been one to ever consider rehoming a pet, but this is getting out of control and could be a real health hazard for our son. Any advise on how to fix this issue?

1667878118,self.CatAdvice,True,"* please no judgement *

Today I made the decision that since i‚Äôm moving to another continent that my amazing and sweet cat will not be coming with me as it would be intensely stressful to be fostered for months and then reuniting with me (airplane and train rides, etc). It was about ~$2700 to cargo her to the UK with me, which was not in budget. My other option was to get someone to foster her till August when I can return to bring her with me and have the space ready. I thought about it and spoke to several people and they have all told me that it would be awfully stressful for her mentally. 

It‚Äôs the most difficult decision I‚Äôve ever made in my life and I am absolutely devastated and beyond heartbroken because she‚Äôs saved my life the 3 years I‚Äôve had her (not an exaggeration), but it‚Äôs best for her to not have all of the stress of 8 months without me and then travelling 12-15 hours to a new place, plus being fostered she will get used to her foster parents and then be sad when she leaves them. It‚Äôs not fair to her. So I am deciding to rehome her to a family or person that can always be there for her and be constantly there. I have a month and a half left with her before I am deciding to drop her off to her forever home. I will probably never see her again. 

Does it ever get better? I feel selfish for wanting to put her through that long gruelling journey. Will I ever come to forgive myself for this? Will she forgive me?

Lots of hissing and growling from the resident cats initially but now all one of them wants to do is play with the kitten. They just chase each other around. The problem is that the other one is still hissing and growling until they're swatting at each other.

We rescued our two kittens back in March and we were so in love - they were about four months. Our younger baby, Tig, was very skinny and small but they couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with her at the time. We rescued her knowing she would likely have health problems but we didn‚Äôt know the extent of it. All I can say is GET PET INSURANCE!!! It allowed us to treat her to the best extent possible and they paid out ¬£12,000 in six months. We are in the U.K. so might be better here not sure. 

About a month in, she started acting a bit strange and sleeping a lot. We took her to the vet who suspected she had FIP but gave us some other things to try. Fast forward, she almost died in the vet hospital with her stomach full of fluid but we were so lucky to save her with a newer approved drug in the U.K. it involved us giving her a shot daily in her back/neck for two weeks which was extremely traumatic honestly. We finally switched to a pill form and three months later, she seemed to be fully recovered. But as soon as she came off the pills, we noticed she started having diahrrea. 

We did every test, multiple stool samples, two ultrasounds, a colon biopsy to finally settle on her having developed IBS. This took about 4 months and the diahrrea just got worse and worse to the point where she can‚Äôt control when she goes. There was also a lot of blood in her stool.

My question is, how much does this affect my cat? He doesn't seem to mind, and he will let me know when he's hungry and when he wants to play. I have no set feeding schedule on the weekends, I leave kibble for him and he snacks on it, but he always waits for wet food for his full meals.

This really stresses out my mom and she‚Äôs the person that usually has to clean them up. Now for some background information, we got our cat in 2020 when he was a few months old, and then we fostered him. Previous to that he had been living with a vet tech with no other kittens. If you have any knowledge of fostering cats, you know that kittens need to be socialized with other kittens so they learn how to get along with other cats and it helps them emotionally develop properly. Well our cat should‚Äôve been given to us earlier but hadn‚Äôt, but anyway we took him in with our other kittens. We already had two other cats at this point. Around New Years 2020 we adopted our cat. Then he started pooping around the house, but less often than he is now. Then we moved houses and this is when the issue started to get worse. He started mostly pooping large amounts around the house. We believe it‚Äôs mostly a behavioral issue. It‚Äôs also important to add that our cat is very small. Like at two years old he‚Äôs about half the size of a fully grown cat when he‚Äôs already full grown. He messes with one of the other cats (let‚Äôs call him tuxedo cat). Tuxedo cat and the third cat (let‚Äôs call him lion cat) our best friends and we think that when lion cats sees tuxedo cat getting bullied he then bullies the cat with issues. Lion cat bullying problem cat could be unrelated to tuxedo cat getting messed with. Anyway the problem has gotten to the point where this is our last straw. It‚Äôs too mentally difficult to deal with it every day. We‚Äôve tried almost every solution and they haven‚Äôt worked, meanwhile the vet bills have been racking up. We recently took him to the vet again and they think it is a behavioral issue so they‚Äôre prescribing him chicken broth prozac and for him to be house trained again for two weeks. We‚Äôre doing that in my sisters room and we put a litter box in her bathroom. We think he has separation anxiety from my sister because they are really close and he‚Äôs always with her. When she‚Äôs not home (which is often because our parents are separated) he will cry outside of her door for hours. The vet also said that the issue may only go away if we if we give him back again to the shelter (no kill) and if he gets adopted again the issue may go away in the new house. We also think that because he wasn‚Äôt socialized at the proper age he may only be able to thrive with no issues in a single cat household.

I'll try to be brief. 4 years ago I've adopted my first cat which was already 4 years old. She has been living with me since then and we live in a small apartment (bathroom, kitchen, living room).
Yesterday, previously taking all the medical precautions with both animals, I brought to my apartment my girlfriend's cat. He will be living with us some time due to some personal issues where the cat was previously living.

The newcomer's attitude is to hide in small and dark places. He licks a bit, gets out for food/water, today he was able to use the litter-box. He walks cautiously through the apartment.
On the other hand, my cat, is being territorial. He growls at him, maintains distance and watches him silently. Usually is a very sweet cat, like a really lot, but now she is being grumpy.

I was expecting some sort of similar scenario and I think, based on similar experiences with dogs or relatives cats, that this is a common situation.

So I switched to Dr. Elsey Ultra....dust free and low tracking.

She will go and lay down in one of her spots for 10-15 minutes.  

I swear she kicks out a tenth of her litter box content every time she uses the bathroom.  

I have a litter collecting mat outside the box, but it doesn't help.

She pees right at the door, even though there‚Äôs a litter box 5 feet away. We‚Äôve seen her use the litter box and STILL pee by the door. My wife has mopped the floor, sprayed enzymes and all kinds of keep-away products and nothing works. Wife lays down foil, Tortie pees. Wife uses Feliway, Tortie pees. Wife blocks the door. Tortie pees as close to the blockade as possible. Oddly, Void never pees there. No clue why.

The one theory I have is mice. We‚Äôve seen two or three mice in the basement over the last two years,  but they don‚Äôt last long. Both cats are hunters. The few mice we‚Äôve seen are in their mouths, displayed proudly. But when I cleaned out the sunroom, I noticed mice droppings. Admittedly, these cats are the first pets I‚Äôve ever had, so maybe my theory is dumb, but I‚Äôm wondering if she‚Äôs peeing there to keep mice away. If so, it‚Äôs admirable, but annoying!

So, does my theory hold water? And if not, what else can I try? We‚Äôve basically lost the use of an entire room of our house because it always smells like cat piss. Any and all suggestions are welcome, I am completely out of my depth and I‚Äôm begging! Help!

The bot took this post down saying we didn‚Äôt take her to the vet, but we have. They say there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything wrong with her. No UTIs in over a year. She‚Äôs healthy.",CatAdvice,My cat is peeing in my basement every day. The vet says she‚Äôs fine. Please help.,
1667772470,self.CatAdvice,True,"My senior cat is starting to have constipation issues. The started when the vet prescribed a joint supplement. My senior cat has already done this once, going to the vet. Got the enema, pissed as hell, came home and within a few hours started perking up. I stopping giving her the joint supplement during that time. 

A month later I start giving it to her prior to figuring out it was causing her dehydration. So she is constipated again. She has had a full day of pumpkin and a mild lax. And we finally saw her pass one hard round small turd. So I know the pumpkin is starting to absorb. 

But I am wondering if I could give her a small enema at home to help relieve pressure from the back end. She has started to puke a little for being all stuffed up. But seeing the one turd gives me hope.

Just trying to decide if I should just keep trying to hydrate her though the front, or lube her up from the back at this point.",CatAdvice,Senior cat constipation issues.,
1667771984,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a 13 year old kitty, let's call her B (name has been withheld to protect what remains of her dignity). And recently, B has been peeing on everything.

Backstory: my husband and I adopted B from a shelter when she was 4. She had previously been in a traffic accident, and is missing her tail and her back right leg as a result. (I suspect she was the one driving the car). B is an indoor cat and always has been - we are in the UK, so this is actually quite unusual, since the majority of cats here are allowed outside. Anyway. Other than the missing limbs, and a couple of mild bouts of cystitis, B has been in great health since we adopted her. Her mobility is limited in that she can't jump up high, just scrambles onto a chair/bed, but she can run fairly fast. Personality-wise, she's a very vocal cat, pretty social and likes to curl up on my lap, but a bit 'emotionally needy'. We have had issues on and off with excessive crying at night, but that has improved in recent years.

B has occasionally done a 'stress pee' outside her litterbox, if upset by something like an unexpected houseguest. Two years ago, we had a baby, and the stress-peeing got a little bit more frequent. Ok, that's not unusual, cats need time to adapt to a baby. We didn't force any interaction, made sure B had her own baby-free retreat space, kept a Feliway running etc. Now baby is a toddler, and to be fair, they are both good companions. B hasn't displayed any aggression and will happily curl up next to toddler; toddler understands 'gentle hands' and generally respects the cat's space. One big difference is that B is now shut out of baby's room at night (she has free range over the rest of our flat).

In the last few months, B has been peeing outside her box a couple of times a week, and suddenly in the last week she is doing it every day. She has two litterboxes, always accessible, one in each bathroom, and we use the same wooden biodegradable litter that we have always used. The boxes are scooped immediately after a poop, and the litter changed weekly. But she's peeing randomly on rugs, chairs, and anything left on the floor for a moment, such as a towel. She even pees near her food bowl now.

When the issue started a few months ago, I took her to our vet. He gave her a physical checkup, found nothing wrong, and said that the issue was behavioural. Liquid fluoxetine (kitty prozac) was prescribed, which we mixed in with her wet food or a cat-yoghurt treat once a day. This worked well for about a month, but then B figured out that the food/treat had medicine mixed in, and refused to touch it. So then we were back at the original problem. I can't get her to take the food via syringe or spoon, because it causes her a huge amount of distress which defeats the whole point of prozac.

I suspect/fear that she is bored, because she will often paw at furniture or the window blinds to make a noise and get our attention. She gets lots of social attention, i.e. petting and lap time, but it's really hard to play with her because she ignores most toys, ribbons, string, balls and so on. I've bought enrichment toys for her, I try hiding ribbons under things for her to find, and she either bats at them for two minutes then loses interest, or just acts like they're not there. I suspect the missing limbs/mobility issues make it harder for her to play.

I have a call scheduled with the vet tomorrow, and obviously will be getting her checked again. She is eating and drinking normally. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions or magical incantations to the cat-gods, please do share!",CatAdvice,My cat is a turning into a pee-monster,

One behaviour though is concerning me, as I‚Äôve never experienced it with other cats. They both love suckling. Petting them can turn into a full blown suckle fest. One of them has today been following me around and every time I sit she cuddles up next to me and start immediately suckling and kneading. She is purring and relaxed, but is this normal for a kitten of this age? Does this mean there is a need I am not fulfilling for them?

1667769298,self.CatAdvice,True,"I fostered a stray litter of 3 this summer. I planned on keeping 2 but fell in love with all of them so I decided to keep them all. I dont have any other animals. Right now they are almost 5 months old. The biggest of the 3 is a pretty orange tabby named Ginger. Lately, about the last 3-4 weeks, he is starting to get skittish with noises. Most of these noises he has heard his whole life, like a vacuum and a blender. Sometimes when he gets into a skittish mood he will even run from me when I approach him. I hold, rub, play with all of them since the day they were born many times a day, so it almost makes me want to cry when he runs from me. When I do sometimes get him in my arms he is quick to purr and be affectionate and closing his eyes. When he comes out of his skittish mood he seems content and happy. He never hids to go to sleep or hids from his brothers. Is this a phase he is going through? Is there anything I can do to help him?",CatAdvice,Scaredy Cat,

1667767348,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I have a 4.5 month old kitten who‚Äôs just began teething. For the past two days he has been reluctant to finish his meals. This boy can EAT, so it is weird for him to leave at least 20% of his meal in his bowl. He‚Äôs getting like 50-100 fewer calories a day. 
He gets both wet and dry food each meal. Three days ago he struggled to chew his dry food so I soaked it and turned it into mash but he won‚Äôt eat that. He will eat most of the wet food but still leaves a good amount in his bowl. I can‚Äôt give him more wet food because that would require him to eat so much more food to get his caloric requirements and he refuses to finish that. I‚Äôve tried. 
I‚Äôve also tried heating food up, cooling food down, teething toys, kitty food popsicles, different bowls, lick mats, flavors etc. 
I‚Äôm not sure if this is typical for a teething kitten. Any advise? Also, I have a vet appointment set up for him this week to discuss this but in the meantime, what can I do for him?",CatAdvice,Encourage teething kitten to eat?,
