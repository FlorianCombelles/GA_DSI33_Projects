0,1669615692,self.DogAdvice,True,"So my family got a new puppy for some background context that’ll make all you dog owners probably face palm (this was not my decision to get a new dog) We own 2 cats and 1 dog the 2 cats don’t fuck with the puppy who’s name is Luna they might hiss if she tries playing with them but never attack her just basically telling Luna to go away. Now the other dog we have is Ivy. I was really young when we got her and you can tell this dog was unfortunately not raised good she puts her ears back and thinks your gonna hit her when you pet her and overall is very skittish of other people except me and my family. We used to have another dog Quincy and quite often the two would get into fights and eventually after one fight Quincy was hurt bad so bad we sadly had to put him down. I don’t blame Ivy she could’ve been raised a lot better where she wouldn’t be aggressive and any sane dog owner would not get a new dog after knowing the dog they have now got the previous dog killed. Just 2 days into having Luna, Ivy thought she was gonna take her bone and attacked her luckily I was right there and broke it up but Luna has a tiny tiny little mark from where Ivy literally had her jaws around her head. I told my mom this and i’m trying to get it through to her that Luna is a American terrier pit bull mixed with a bull (or atleast I think i’m not a dog person really so I don’t know breeds) So having this young puppy grow up where a dog is attacking her will have her grow up and be aggressive back to other dogs and even Ivy. She’s gonna be a big dog and I really don’t wanna see two big ass dogs go at it because it will most likely end very very bad. So now I really don’t know what to do it’s unfair to get rid of Ivy and it’s a little risky to try and raise Luna in this type of environment. so far i’ve kinda been the one to step up and train Luna to be a good dog as-well as giving Ivy attention and trying to get the two to bond it’s stressful I will say especially cause i can’t be around the two 24/7 and my mom thinks it’s perfectly fine to leave the two dogs in the house alone without putting Luna in a room to keep away from Ivy. I think after I get paid ill buy a crate to put her in for the time being till she’s older because when no one’s home and if Ivy attacks no one can break up that fight and Luna will grow up to view Ivy as dangerous and eventually start fighting back and a pitbull going up against a husky is not something I want to happen man. So overall any advice is really needed, is there a way I can retrain Ivy to be more confident and not skittish? and even have her be less aggressive to the puppy.

1,1669614240,self.DogAdvice,True,"Pretty self-explanatory title. I have a 9 mo old GSD and a 2.5 yr old bengal cross cat. My pup is obsessed with my cat. Not in like a stalking prey-drive way, but like an idolizing way. He adores her. Steals slippers and brings them to her as a gift lol. 

Now, my cat is a covid-cat and prior to getting my dog was an only fur-child. She's very possessive of me to say the least. There have been these instances that show my cat truly *loves* my dog, but she certainly doesn't *like* him. He is everything she hates – loud, smelly, hyper, and too close to me. 

My cat has grown more tolerant and lets him come near her but sometimes he gets too carried away poking her with his nose or jumping up towards where she is so she will hiss or growl. He gets more excited and keeps going so she'll start smacking him but he just doesn't leave her alone. The other day she managed to scratch his eye. He's ok but he very much has not learned anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some important points to add here: 

\- They are never left alone. If I or my roommate have to leave, my dog is in his crate. I don't suspect anything would happen but I don't want to find out

\- My dog's body language has never been threatening. It's playful and light and seems like he genuinely just wants to play

\- My cat doesn't instigate anything, she just is defensive.

I think for humping (he says it's dominance but hasn't that been debunked?) getting him more exercise should help right? Right now he gets maybe, and I do mean maybe, a 5 minute walk everyday or every other day.

Marking- he is intact but he is also 8?(we think) I will be speaking to my vet about neutering and if it's safe for his age but what enzyme cleaner would be best to help with marking and to prevent it?

31,1669567117,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi all, 

I adopted my puppy from a shelter at 6 months old- she was already spayed when we adopted her. Since day 1 we noticed that she was having frequent pee accidents in the house. I suspected a UTI and it turned out to be the case (even though the vet was skeptical, I was adamant that it wasn’t just behavioral). The uti was still there after a week of antibiotics. The vet then suggested to do a month long course of antibiotics, which we are now coming to the end of. 

Now and a few times previously I have noticed that my pup sometimes leaks urine when she’s sleeping.

I am taking her back for a follow up with the vet this week, but she has had a radiograph in the last month to rule out stones. 

I’m wondering if anyone out there has had a similar experience with a pup that was spayed very young? Is it poor muscle tone?

Or has anyone experienced incontinence in dogs who receive calming treats with hemp seed powder? (She takes two of the Zesty paws calming bites daily as recommended by the brand for her weight) I’m considering taking this out of her regiment as an experiment to see if there are any improvements until we actually see the vet.

44,1669534518,self.DogAdvice,True,"My last post was really a typical post about separation anxiety or isolation stress, and the automod posted some useful links for advice to follow, so I'll start that asap.

This post is more about some specific advice to manage the situation as I attempt to resolve it.

Basically, the dog barks through the night, I get up, try to settle him back in his crate, which never works, so I end up letting him in the living room to sleep on the sofa. I (try to) sleep on the other sofa, so he's doubly rewarded by getting to sleep on the sofa AND have me there with him.

The alternative, that I've just thought about while I lie awake on the sofa after another night of barely any sleep, is to actually set up a camp bed in the kitchen to see if he will then sleep through the night, and allow the rest of the house (and neighbours) to actually get some sleep.

I'm just wondering what the least-worst option is right now to save the family's sanity - keep letting him in the living room to sleep when he wakes up during the night, or seeing if he'll sleep though with me on a camp bed in the kitchen with him?

He's on a bland diet because of associated GI distress so I'm really limited on what I can mix it with to get him to take it. I tried mixing it with the chicken and rice, he's refusing to eat it even though he's hungry.

My dog is a bit on the reactive/high strung side. He isn't aggressive but he will bite if I invade his space too much. He's also wary of us because he was manhandled (understandably) at the vet and he isn't feeling well. So even getting to his mouth with the syringe without him showing his teeth or snapping is a challenge.

He has an open wound where they drained the abscess so it can continue to drain so I really don't want to wrestle him and risk hurting him.

58,1669515254,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi friends, first time rescue mum over here. I’m learning all I can about my new dog—it’s information overload on the web/YouTube so your advice and perspectives are very appreciated.

We adopted our wonderful Raya (2F) from the shelter 3 weeks ago. I’ve observed she LOVES food, nothing she won’t do for a training treat and mealtime is her favorite time. Raya loves the kibble dispensing toys, Lick Mats, Snuffle Mats, stuffed Kongs, you name it. I work from home, so I’m happy to give her these things throughout the day to keep her occupied.

But Raya is frequently peeing in the house (1-2x daily for weeks) despite being healthy and taken outside frequently and given lavish praise/treats for toileting outside. Usually a few ounces of urine in the same spots each time, and I never catch her doing it. 

Seems like whenever I take my eyes off her to focus on something else (my dish, the stove, vacuuming), she’ll stealth-pee and act like nothing happened. I don’t discipline/yell at her or anything, of course.

What’s usually happening when she pees—we’re eating, there’s people food around (I cook a lot), she’s playing with her Wobble (kibble dispensing toy), she’s got some sort of food toy like a Snuffle mat, I’ve left the room and she’s alone or with husband (who she likes but she spends far less time with), I’m vacuuming (I crate her and go slowly/avoid her area to not scare her).

Raya gets 2-3 25+ min walks + quick potty breaks daily, I’d guess she’s outside every few hours (I even set timers). But she’s quite content snoozing on the couch all day.

I’m wondering if it’s possible I’ve rushed her transition to a new home and overloaded her, especially with too much high stimulus food toy time? 

My initial approach was to build up her confidence being alone, since she’d whine/pace/be destructive whenever I’d leave the floor. Also it seemed like she spent a lot of time snoozing or following me around. So, I started giving her a lot of food toy distractions and leave, hoping she’d associate good things with being alone.

What’s going on and what could I be doing wrong? How can I stop the inappropriate peeing?

59,1669513178,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have lived in my current apartments for more than 3 years and have had my dog for as of today 1 year and 8 months, a maltipoo that weighs no more than 8.5 pounds. I had downstairs neighbors who were always great and our friends, never seemed to complain about a single thing and even then we would acknowledge if we were a bit loud and apologize to them when we could. There were over 3 people living in that apartment and they had a dog the same as us so my dog was always able to play around with their dog and we all got along great. Eventually though they moved and in came new neighbors and no more than a few weeks later we began to hear them hitting their roof with most likely a broom and at first we didn’t know what it was for as we all tend to stay in our rooms or on the couch, but as time went on we noticed this was happening while my dog ran around with zoomies. Eventually we got a note on our door stating they were tired of the noise and have knocked on our door many times to speak to our face about the matter, but it never said anything about the disturbance of sleep or work mind you, and they said they would hear it more in the afternoon than any other time which no one is home from 11-4 so we had a chat with them face to face and explained the noise as well as introduced our pet to them to clear it up. So we apologized and went our way but fast forward maybe not 2 days later we’re hearing the banging again after trying our best to keep our dog calm and sat, but with the endless hitting of the roof we begin to care less and less and become more annoyed with them as we are try our best to keep our dog quiet and no later than 8:30 too and it’s to be courteous but I will admit I’ve come home at maybe 12 am before and have seen then up and moving almost seems they never sleep, but nonetheless even during the day and afternoon the sound seems still too much and they are constantly complaining. We have carpet, the apartments allow pets, my dog doesn’t have overly long nails as he gets groomed regularly, and the zoomies never last past maybe 10 minutes.

For years they actually only fed him bologna and didn’t even buy dry food. This bothers me so much because there is soooo much salt in bologna. Their argument is that “he’s blind so he deserves a treat” and “it’s the only thing he eats” and “he’s old so it doesn’t matter anyways”.

62,1669508442,self.DogAdvice,True,"I can't tell if I'm not being supported enough or if I'm just being stupid

Since I was really young, I've always wanted a papillon dog (tiny dog with pretty ears for those who don't know).  Even when I was a child and didn't know the breed I would draw that exact dog on my school work constantly.


A few months ago I got a dog, a german shepherd puppy, which caused me to have a panic attack since she was so big and clumsy and I worried she would hurt my cat. With a heavy heart, I had to give her away. I was convinced to consider a other cat instead, but deep down I knew I didn't want another cat. I want to take care of a dog. My sister can do it, why can't I?


The problem now is my mother. She's really upsetting me telling me I can't handle a dog when she knows the reason I freaked out. An adult, small, calm temperament dog fixes the problem, and she recommended the solution in the first place. But now she's saying I can't do it and it's breaking my heart. My cat would love some company, he's fine around dogs and loves when other cats come to the window (they don't like him as much as he likes them though).

63,1669508407,self.DogAdvice,True,"We adopted our pup around two years ago when she was approximately 3 months old. One of her littermates had a DNA test done and they are true mutts, but their closest breed matches were Australian Cattle Dog &amp; Boxer. In most aspects, she is a fantastic dog. Loyal, smart, energetic, sweet, and a great big sister to our 5 month old shepherd. 

However, whenever she is let outside she seeks an escape, no matter where or how much space she’s given. We live in the city but have a reasonably-sized fenced in yard. She is CONSTANTLY searching for or creating holes in the fence trying to escape. When she’s at the dog park, which is a massive space of land, she is sniffing the perimeter searching for a way to leave. When we visit my mom, who lives on an acre+ of fenced in land and has other dogs for her to play with, she STILL seeks a way to leave.

When we picked her up for adoption, she was flagged by the agency as a flight risk, which we took to mean she would flee when panicked or scared. We were gentle in our care and have done all we know how to do to make her comfortable. We do not believe she is fleeing from fear, just maybe curiosity and boredom.

She does not lack in enrichment and exercise. She goes for long walks, runs around like crazy in our yard, visits the dog park almost every day, and plays with our other dog 24/7. She eats well, sleeps well, etc.

Has anyone dealt with this before? We would love any insight and advice. We of course take all precautions to keep her safe, especially in the city, and we don’t leave her out for long stretches, and never alone. But it feels like every time we let our guard down she finds a way to get out.

I’m also concerned about the mucus? I gave her a bit of boiled brown rice about a day ago, could it be too high in fibre for her/ irritating her digestive process?

73,1669483154,self.DogAdvice,True,"I was wondering if anyone else has a similar issue with their pup. My 10 months old mutt is slowly stopping to eat/not eating her whole bowl of dry kibble at lunchtime. I feed her twice a day, once at noon and once in the evening. For lunchtime she's barely eating, but in the evening she gobbles down her food. She seems otherwise normal, being the energetic trouble maker as always. It has been getting hotter and drier during the last few days, so I'm wondering if maybe the heat is causing her to lose some apetite during the day. Or maybe she's fed up with dry kibble and only eats after her evening walk when she's actually truly hungry?

Anyhow, just wanted to know if you guys have had similar experiences with your pups. She's scheduled to do full blood work next week as a check up (she's had a rough start in life with multiple health issues) so if anything is off I'll know soon.

76,1669469330,self.DogAdvice,True,"My 6year old dog (mixed breed but not sure exactly what breed since he was a rescue, about 18lbs) has been sick for the last two weeks and the vet can’t figure out what is wrong with him. 

About 7 weeks ago he hurt his back legs/back. He was outside to pee and he yelped randomly. We brought him to the vet and they said it might be a slipped disk and to keep him off his back two legs as much as possible. For about 3-4 weeks after he couldn’t walk up the stairs in our home and he had some weakness in his back legs. 

He started to get better but was never at 100%. We tried to limit his walking up stairs as much as we could because we wanted him to give his body a chance to heal. 

Then about 6 weeks after the injury he started to get gastro symptoms. He started to throw up and diarrhea. We brought him to the vet and they did a blood test and found that his white blood cells were elevated. He started to recover from the gastro 4 days later but the vet had recommended we put him on antibiotics due to the elevated white blood cells. We started the antibiotics on day 4 of him having gastro like symptoms. On day 5 he started to act more like himself. He had an appetite again and was more or less back to normal except his back legs were still weak. He was back to normal for 6 days then at night he started shaking and wouldn’t eat his food. 

We brought him back to the vet the next day and he had a fever of 104.5. We were sent for X-rays to check for any issues with his hips, legs, and chest and all came back normal. We also did blood work to check for ticks, heart worm and other tick borne illnesses and all came back clear as well. 

The following day he was sent for an ultrasound and he came back all clear as well. However he still had a fever of 104.18. At this point the vet is not sure what can be causing him to be sick. We were given a stronger antibiotic that also has some anti inflammatory in it and just started him on this last night. They’re thinking it might be an acute infection somewhere that they haven’t been able to locate OR the start of pancreatitis, however they’re not sure at this point.

Has anyone had a similar experience with their pup? Any ideas/advice on how to help him?

80,1669465583,self.DogAdvice,True,"My parents adopted a Great Pyrenees puppy two days ago, she is a 5 month old female. One of my relatives said they saw her walking around before we came in, but the moment us and the breeder came into her space, she was cornering herself, acting shy and not moving or trying to get away from us, while the golden retriever in the cage next to her was jumping and licking our hands. I know a Pyr isn't quite as playful as a Golden, but the breeder told us this one have always been shy and her sister who was adopted one day before was said to be active and playful. The breeder told us they did not fed her this day, so she doesn't puke in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

In the car (my parents were driving for two hours), she kept doing this thing where she was pointing her snout to her stomach and she farted a few times. When we came back home, she was cornering herself, looking at us like we had just punished her, and refused to eat and drink until night, also didn't pee and poop the day my parents took her home.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she both peed and poop and it looked normal, she agreed to eat (same brand as the breeder fed her, something ProPlan) and drink, and today the same. She is still isn't particularly active or cuddly, though, and all she wants to do is go in the garden, but she mostly pees at home (hopefully, that is just temporary). We haven't been able to walk her outside of the garden yet, because she doesn't move much and she is very stubborn about it. She is not fearful at all with our cats and us, though. She is shy, and extremely calm (she barked just once), but not exactly scared of us.

&amp;#x200B;

She still does the snout pointing at her stomach, though, and I think she farted again, I'm not sure if it's anything we should be worried about?

I'm the only one who can really do anything as my parents aren't willing to pay for a dog trainer or put in any work themselves. My dad isn't great with him and is too prideful to admit it or ask for help and my mom just doesn't get involved.

&amp;#x200B;

it should be said he of course is a big dog much bigger than most german shepherds up to 90-110 pounds. When we walk and he sees another dog he starts going rigid just staring at the dog sometimes just sniffing the ground and using that as a way to just look at the dog and then as the dog gets closer his ears will go up and he'll get more rigid and if the dog gets too close he'll start pulling and sometimes growling and barking. I've tried so many times to break his cycle I've used spray bottles to try and get his attention  I've tried ignoring the dog and to keep walking and so that he may take the hint as I've found he tends to look back at me before doing a lot of things but it's like he can't make the connection that he's doing something wrong. He's had dog friends in the past he had a little chihuahua friend that got hit by a car. When I'm not around or when he's at doggy daycare our family has been told that he does fine with other dogs. He's had this problem for a long time but I think it worsened when he was once attacked by a mastiff at around 1 or 2 years old and my dad would probably encourage bad behavior or treat him in ways that did not help him developmentally.

88,1669447432,self.DogAdvice,True,"So about ten months ago, we adopted a dog from a buddy. Hela is a Shi Tzu mutt mix of some kind that they found on the side of the road in the desert about six years ago- she is now roughly 10 years old.

Long story short- buddy works long hours and so does his wife. Hela stayed in a crate overnight and as long as they were at work. Then buddy got two husky pups- and proceeded to not have time for them either. All of them were crated excessively and often together in one large crate which resulted in Hela getting bullied by the huskies.

It was only after she started losing massive amounts of weight did he bother to think about rehoming her. I should mention this is my husband's buddy- who lived nearly two hours from us so we didn't really see the dogs at all until he brought up his difficulty trying to get a shelter to take her.

She was severely matted, dragged her belly across the floor because she was so scared of everything, and emaciated. It was terrible. We decided to take her home, and we've had her ever since.

We've been approaching things one at a time- earning whatever trust she'll give us, getting her used to being on a leash and going on walks, working on her anxiety- little by little. She's now a healthy weight and still super anxious, but it's not nearly a bad as those first few months. We're working with a vet on maybe getting her medicated to sort out the rest since it feels like her days are just so miserable still.

I'm home most of the day, my husband is Navy so he's gone for fair amounts of time. We take her out every 4-6 hours (no yard) which is what we've found to be her limit for bathroom needs.


However. Nighttime is a different story.

Because of the years of excessive crating, she's unable to be left in a crate. Well, I suppose she could, but she's thrashing, crying, and trying to dig her way out the entire time. We didn't really have an option to not crate her, because she's only partially housebroken and I need to sleep. If not crated, she'll mess in the house. Every time. We've tried crate training too, but there's just no point. It's instant deathly panic every time, even if she's in the room with us while crated. Just seeing the crate changes her mood, and she's not a very happy dog to begin with so it's just heartbreaking.

We've finally decided to give up on it - it's not worth the stress she goes through every day and there's literally nowhere I can put her in the apartment that is far enough that she won't wake me up multiple times a night with her panic.

But. Housebreaking.

She technically is housebroken - she knows that she goes to the bathroom outside. However, she will not tell us if she needs to go. Bell training, touch training- nothing worked. She will not tell us. And she will not hold it either. She just goes. Not an issue during the day, but I need to sleep.

We used puppy pads for awhile, thinking there was some success but then we caught our senior cat using them and we found out we were just teaching HIM to piss on the carpet instead. It took months to fix and get him back to using a litter box. Pads are not an option.

So right now it's pretty much either 1) crate her to prevent messing on the carpet overnight, which will destroy her mental health or 2) accept she will piss on the carpet and that there is nothing to be done, just do our best to carpet clean every week. I'm almost to the point of not caring either way, because this stress combined with everything else is way too much on me. Our senior cat is near the end of his life and taking up most of my time and attention- I don't have much left in me.

I have no idea what options we have left are, except maybe diapers overnight. I don't even know if she'll leave them be, or chew them off. She's fine with her winter jacket, but who knows?

Any ideas or advice would be welcome.",1,Complicated housebreaking...,text,723,"['complicated', 'housebreaking', 'ten', 'month', 'ago', 'adopted', 'dog', 'buddy', 'hela', 'shi', 'tzu', 'mutt', 'mix',

93,1669434402,self.DogAdvice,True,"My 1.5 year old Cavalier is great in her crate at night at home. We go for the bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed when we come in, sleeping through the night. 

Whenever I visit my parents, however, it’s a different story. Generally her anxiety levels go up for the first day or two we’re here. I assume that is because sometimes she stays with them when I travel for work, so she’s unsure if I’m staying or going. When I leave her with them she’s totally fine at night. 

The issue is when I am staying at their house. We do her bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed like at home. But minutes later she is barking. The only solution I’ve found is to go sleep on the couch with her for 30mins to an hour and then put her back to bed. (Usually we’ve spent the hours before bedtime laying on the couch watching a movie so it’s not like she’s missing snuggle time!)

This isn’t regulated to my parents’ house. This summer we got a vacation rental (just me and the dog) and it took to night 4 for her to go to bed with no barking.

My 5 month old Rottweiler mix has had diarrhea for a few days now. 
A couple weeks ago we decided to switch her food. We started off with giving her 1/2 cup new food with 1 1/2 old food twice a day for about 5 days. Then we did 1 cup new food 1 cup old food twice a day for another 5 days, and then did 1 1/2 cups new food and 1/2 cup old food until the old food ran out (around 4 days). She wasn’t having diarrhea until a few days ago probably around the time we started giving her 2 cups twice a day of new food. She is acting completely normal and still full of energy, just up at all hours of the night with the shits and I come home from work with at least one pile of diarrhea on the floor.

102,1669419286,self.DogAdvice,True,"My older dog is acting up, growled and raised his lip at me

We got a puppy(male)  4 months ago and he is now around the half year mark, he is a nice puppy but sometimes can be somewhat annoying, my older dog (3y male) sometimes reminds him of that by growling at him for a brief second until he submits.
My older dog has show no major issues other than dominating the younger dog, never harming the puppy but playing mouthing games or making him submit when he crosses a line( going after his snack, jumping at his face etc.)
The way we feed them is to tell them to go on their bed, afterwards we put their bowls in their spot and give them the command to go after 3-5 seconds)
I normally feed them at the same time, but a recent trend has happened, where my older dog approaches my puppy, ignoring his own food, and growls at him, when this happens i normally separate them and have them eat alone. 
Today though, he started growling at my puppy and making him submit before i even made them go to bed or put the food down. I found this behaviour bad so 
I sent my dog to another room closed the door and fed the puppy. Then i locked my puppy into a different room and tried to feed the older dog. I put his food down and then told him to go on his bed, but instead of doing so he turned towards me, raised his lips and growled at me, I have previously had a negative experience where he nipped me( less than a cm deep) on my arm when I accidentally provoked( i realise what i did wrong there) but this time it seems almost entirely unprovoked.

My sweet little dog, a 1yo Cavalier, chokes on treats very easily. We use her kibble for regular treats on walks (Royal Canin Digestive Care Mini) which she seems to enjoy except for the fact that she has choked on them multiple times now.

She has this kibble for breakfast but the choking has really only occurred while we use it as a treat on walks so far.

This obviously terrifies me. Today was particularly scary as at took multiple attempts before we dislodged the treat and she breathed.

Obviously, we won't be using the kibble for treats again. I am calling our vet tomorrow to see if she needs to be checked over for it, and booking a first aid course.

Because she was vomiting from the chocolate they put her on a round of antibiotics; she was doing better with the insulin combined with antibiotics, and we took her to the vet yesterday to have a blood glucose monitor installed on her where she was then diagnosed with Pyometra. Her blood sugar is extremely high at 350+ (over what our reader can see) and the pyometra has made her resistant to insulin. For those unfamiliar, pyometra is an infection in the uterus which causes the uterus to rupture this filling the abdomen with pus (where the dog will die in less than a couple of days). We unfortunately don’t have the money for emergency pyometra surgery (ranging from $1-3k) and we’re going to have to put her down within the next week to avoid a super painful eventual death; she has a life expectancy of a couple more weeks with pyometra. I had a gofundme set up for cataract surgery to restore her eyesight, which raised around $330, and was going to use that for her urgent pyometra surgery instead but unfortunately it isn’t enough money and we won’t be able to raise enough within the next week to save her.
I just wanted to know how to cope with this. We have no option but to euthanize her and this has been extremely tough for my family and I as she is our first pet. To anyone whose pet passed away I really would like to understand the grieving process and if it’ll get any easier. It has been hard enough already and it’s only been a day since the news; I hope I had done enough for her with the gofundme and all which didn’t raise much but that was my effort. This was all very sudden as she was happy and healthy just a couple of weeks ago. I’ll be spending my last week with her doing everything she loves.

127,1669350858,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 2.5 yo ACD mix who has a history of HGE. Dog had little appetite and loose stool so put him on a sensitive stomach food and daily probiotic and both seemed to improve a little bit still having bouts of HGE.

His poop went from a little loose to really pretty dry. Not long enough to know whether HGE will reoccur m. 

Does anyone have a dog on this food with some insight? At $55/7 lbs I’m hoping we may not always need to be on this but I suspect we will. Should I be concerned about the dry stool and anyway to fix it? Was your dog ever able to have treats again or did you have to stay on a really strict diet?

I'm a brand new owner of a now 3 month old ""field line"" golden retriever. We are not hunters, just didn't realize goldens..were actually working dogs. Silly me. 

Anyway, I'm not gonna just force her to be a dog she isn't and it's clear already that she has some kind of prey drive or wants to go get birds. We got her from breeders that are hunters, and breed/train for huntin' dogs. 


So I'm wondering what kind of games/tasks are enriching for my ginger. Obviously fetch is a hit.. and I will be getting her a flirt pole. 

Is there anything else I can do to stimulate her retriever brain besides becoming an actual fowl hunter? Lol

Also, she loves to dig. The snuffle mats on Amazon seem lame, I tried one for my 2yo bichon and I just can't see how it's made for digging or even nose work.

I have been considering getting a dog for a long time and ultimately decided to move forward with it because I think it will be beneficial for my health. 

I have CFS, which impacts my health greatly. I’m often drained on energy and it’s often difficult to get out of bed. I do have some good days where I’m able to get outside for a light walk. 

With that being said, I am looking for a breed that does well with my condition. One that will relax with me when not feeling well, but happy to go out on a walk when I can. Additionally, I want a breed that is known not to bark a lot and also doesn’t shed. Size range around 20-40lbs.

A dog that greatly interests me is a welsh terrier. Although I’m not sure if they are too active? I’ve always loved Airedale terriers and this is just a smaller version of them.

Not too long ago I adopted a senior.  A tiny chi-minpin-whoknoes mix.  15 and blind, not very human-focused when I got her.  Over the last couple months she's changed a lot, for the better.  She's relaxed, affectionate and even playful.

Before her the smallest dog I'd ever owned was 80 lbs +.  Most of her behaviors I think I'm doing fine reading, except for her yawning. 

She will find me and sit at my feet, and sometimes paw at my leg to be picked up.  Often when I do pick her up, she will yawn multiple times when I start petting her.  When I set her down again, she'll do the ""shake off"" stress thing.

 I'm used to multiple or out-of-context yawns being a sign of stress.  She's older and has had a rough time of it (multiple homes etc etc).

I desperately need help. 
I have a 3 year old Aussie who has been having difficulty standing up from laying down for a few months. If I’m being honest I thought he maybe ran or played too hard and that it would pass. He was his normal self besides the struggle to get up, he was still eating and would play with me. Before all of this, I would come home he would be SO excited and jump up on me. Well now, I noticed he stopped jumping up on my bed, stopped jumping on me and barely shows excitement, and is still having major difficulty getting off the ground. Cut to now, he can barely get up, he sits slowly and oddly, he’s very slow when walking, and has no interest in fetch or playing. He seems absolutely exhausted and down, and never wants to get up. Nothing gets him excited and I can tell he is struggling so badly with something or in a lot of pain. I’ve been thinking it was maybe arthritis or something similar. However he’s been to the vet (for allergies) during the time this has been happening and all of his tests and exams were normal. 

My pup has been with my mom who he stays with a lot and adores, and I just got home to see the obvious worsening of whatever is going on. Nothing has changed with his diet or routine except eating less. I immediately notice tonight that he is NOT well and rush him to the ER. You would think he was a very very old dog the way he moves and he was sitting very oddly with both legs pushed to the side. He could also barely get in my car which he never had issues jumping into. 

I explain this in way more detail to the vet. I tell her he is not hisself whatsoever and that I’ve never seen him like this. She checked him out from head to toe and my dog didn’t express any pain in her checks of his body. I told her that he cried today when I was trying to examine his paws and she said he didn’t do that. Basically she said we can do a full body X-ray that would be absurdly expensive, or I go to an orthopedic specialist. I absolutely do not have 1500 to spare for X-rays, especially if that doesn’t show us what we’re looking for. I’m sobbing because seeing him like this is breaking my heart and I may have to find a way to do the X-rays asap because it’s eating me up inside. 

If this sounds remotely relatable to anyone, would you go the X-ray route first? Or maybe other testing? I do not know what to do or where to start especially knowing how expensive all of this will be. I really need some help or peace of mind. 💔",1,"Please help - just left vet but so scared, my dog can barely move",text,504,"['please', 'help', 'left', 'vet', 'scared', 'dog', 'barely', 'move', 'desperately', 'need', 'help', '3', 'year', 'old', 'aussie', 'difficulty', 'standing', 'laying', 'month', 'honest', 'thought', 'maybe', 'ran', 'played', 'hard', 'would', 'pas', 'normal', 'self', 'besides', 'struggle', 'get', 'still', 'eating', 'would', 'play', 'would', 'come', 'home', 'would', 'excited', 'jump', 'well', 'noticed', 'stopped', 'jumping', 'bed', 'stopped', 'jumping', 'barely', 'show', 'excitement', 'still', 'major', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'ground', 'cut', 'barely', 'get', 'sits', 'slowly', 'oddly', 'slow', 'walking', 'interest', 'fetch', 'playing', 'seems', 'absolutely', 'exhausted', 'never', 'want', 'get', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'tell', 'struggling', 'badly', 'something', 'lot', 'pain', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'arthritis', 'something', 'similar', 'however', 'vet', 'allergy', 'time', 'happening', 'test', 'exam', 'normal', 'pup', 'mom', 'stay', 'lot', 'adores', 'got', 'home', 'see', 'obvious', 'worsening', 'whatever', 'going', 'nothing', 'changed', 'diet', 'routine', 'except', 'eating', 'le', 'immediately', 'notice', 'tonight', 'well', 'rush', 'er', 'would', 'think', 'old', 'dog', 'way', 'move', 'sitting', 'oddly', 'leg', 'pushed', 'side', 'could', 'also', 'barely', 'get', 'car', 'never', 'issue', 'jumping', 'explain', 'way', 'detail', 'vet', 'tell', 'hisself', 'whatsoever', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'checked', 'head', 'toe', 'dog', 'express', 'pain', 'check', 'body', 'told', 'cried', 'today', 'trying', 'examine', 'paw', 'said', 'basically', 'said', 'full', 'body', 'xray', 'would', 'absurdly', 'expensive', 'go', 'orthopedic', 'specialist', 'absolutely', '1500', 'spare', 'xrays', 'especially', 'show', 'u', 'looking', 'sobbing', 'seeing', 'like', 'breaking', 'heart', 'may', 'find', 'way', 'xrays', 'asap', 'eating', 'inside', 'sound', 'remotely', 'relatable', 'anyone', 'would', 'go', 'xray', 'route', 'first', 'maybe', 'testing', 'know', 'start', 'especially', 'knowing', 'expensive', 'really', 'need', 'help', 'peace', 'mind', '']",please help left vet scared barely move desperately need help  year old aussie difficulty standing laying month honest thought maybe ran played hard would pas normal self besides struggle get still eating would play would come home would excited jump well noticed stopped jumping bed stopped jumping barely show excitement still major difficulty getting ground cut barely get sits slowly oddly slow walking interest fetch playing seems absolutely exhausted never want get nothing get excited tell struggling badly something lot pain thinking maybe arthritis something similar however vet allergy time happening test exam normal pup mom stay lot adores got home see obvious worsening whatever going nothing changed diet routine except eating le immediately notice tonight well rush er would think old way move sitting oddly leg pushed side could also barely get car never issue jumping explain way detail vet tell hisself whatsoever never seen like checked head toe express pain check body told cried today trying examine paw said basically said full body xray would absurdly expensive go orthopedic specialist absolutely  spare xrays especially show u looking sobbing seeing like breaking heart may find way xrays asap eating inside sound remotely relatable anyone would go xray route first maybe testing know start especially knowing expensive really need help peace mind
158,1669259869,self.DogAdvice,True,"Okay so my German shepherd 1y/o was neutered two weeks ago and is still all cone'd up. He's on cone duty another week because he opened the wound a tiny bit the other day (Vet said it was fine, barely opened at all just enough to bleed a teeny bit, gave us antibiotics just in case). Now, we haven't gotten to play very much because he's only interested in playtime that involves running around and getting chased. He comes outside with me whenever I smoke (every hour or so) and we're out there 10, 15 minutes maybe, and he usually does his business then if he needs to. I've seen him hold it nearly an entire day (when we first got him a couple months ago, he was shy in the new home) too so I know he can.

Tonight I found a big ol' dump in the hallway. Like, so big you'd think a human left it there after hitting a buffet. After cleaning, he and I play fetch inside for a bit, since he's mostly healed. I discover a pee puddle that he must've left as a surprise for me earlier. I clean it up and close him out of the room while I do so. When I come out into the hallway guess who's standing over a nice fresh huge NEW puddle of pee? I can understand puddle #2 since he was all excited and I cut him off from playtime abruptly so he might not have been able to control myself, but with the pattern he established over the last few hours it has me concerned.

I also have a couple fish tanks sitting outside full of water to test they won't break. It's cold out, and they're covered in condensation. When I took him out with me like 20 minutes ago, he started nudging and rubbing his nose up against the side of one of the tanks and sort of stumbling side to side. I don't know what he was doing, he wasn't licking it. He might've been trying to check out a bug he saw or something, which would explain a lot because he might've just been stumbling trying to get closer to the bug with the cone in the way, but at the same time what if it's not that, you know? He's being good right now and sleeping in his favorite chair. 

Anyone have any ideas on why? Maybe he's just sick of the lack of stimulation since the neuter and he's acting out with the peeing/pooping inside? And the tank thing was just a bug he saw? Or could this be something more serious?

Since we've had her shes gotten in 2 pretty minor fights with female dogs, one was YESTERDAY, but gets along great with my male dog. 

Anyways, I'm moving in with a friend who has a male dog (same breed as mine) whos about 70lbs. I'm supposed to be taking both of my dogs into move with her and I'm scared they wont get along and something will happen.

Any advice? My best bet was to only have them around each other when we can keep an eye on them for a couple months, so I could drop my dogs off at my Mom's when I have to work.  But since this other fight just happened I dont know what to think.",1,Will these dogs get along?,text,193,"['dog', 'get', 'along', 'sorry', 'might', 'kind', 'long', '2', 'dog', 'theyre', 'big', '90lbs', 'theyve', 'gotten', 'along', 'really', 'well', 'ive', 'male', 'dog', '9', 'year', 'got', '2', 'month', 'old', 'he', 'sweet', 'listens', 'got', 'female', 'dog', '2', 'year', 'ago', 'rescue', 'sure', 'old', 'guessing', '5', 'year', 'old', 'since', 'weve', 'shes', 'gotten', '2', 'pretty', 'minor', 'fight', 'female', 'dog', 'one', 'yesterday', 'get', 'along', 'great', 'male', 'dog', 'anyways', 'im', 'moving', 'friend', 'male', 'dog', 'breed', 'mine', 'who', '70lbs', 'im', 'supposed', 'taking', 'dog', 'move', 'im', 'scared', 'wont', 'get', 'along', 'something', 'happenany', 'advice', 'best', 'bet', 'around', 'keep', 'eye', 'couple', 'month', 'could', 'drop', 'dog', 'mom', 'work', 'since', 'fight', 'happened', 'dont', 'know', 'think']",get along sorry might kind long  theyre big lbs theyve gotten along really well ive male  year got  month old he sweet listens got female  year ago rescue sure old guessing  year old since weve shes gotten  pretty minor fight female one yesterday get along great male anyways im moving friend male breed mine who lbs im supposed taking move im scared wont get along something happenany best bet around keep eye couple month could drop mom work since fight happened dont know think

She does this a lot of the time. During the day when she's on the sofa, or her bed. During the evening and the night.

Her foster parents from whom I took her told me that she was doing that when she was with them as well (they had her for almost 1 year)

196,1669167414,self.DogAdvice,True,"We went to the vet a few months ago for a suspected uti. She was drinking a bit more than usual and peeing more often on walks. It wasn’t anything too dramatic but just a small notice. There was 1 day she kept asking to go out which prompted the vet visit. 

Urinalysis found suspected bacteria &amp; we were given antibiotics. She toke them for 4 days until the urine culture came back negative in which I stopped. The vet said it was probably not a uti then. During this visit we also did a blood test and x rays but everything was normal except high bilirubin. 

We went back to do another blood test a week or two ago and it’s a different doctor this time (but the same clinic) who is going over the last visit. He mentions something the other vet didn’t which is my dogs urine has a pH of 9 which could indicate a uti. I opted not to do another urinalysis or urine culture because of what the other vet said and just process with blood work. It came back normal. Bilirubin levels were within range. 

These past few days, the drinking water has increased where it’s so noticeable. Few months ago even though I noticed a bit of an increase in intake of water, her pee was still yellow as usual. She generally doesn’t drink that much water anyways. Now it’s like light yellow to clear. And she’s peeing way more often on walks. She’s also gained a few pounds which the 2nd vet noticed.

206,1669151880,self.DogAdvice,True,"I got my dog in late 2019, wanted to make sure she had all of her important vaccines before I started major socialization (I had plans of her going EVERYWHERE with me) and then Covid happened and I already worked from home. Now I have a 3 year old skittish pandemic puppy.

I've been taking her a lot more places for the past six months or so and she's doing a bit better and is less panicky. Occasionally, she's even excited to see some of my friends and immediately letting them pet her, but if I take her to my boyfriend's place (she's been around him about a dozen times) for a couple of days, she's still nervous the entire time, wants to put off eating, will only sleep if she's on the bed at my feet, etc. She's not panicked, but definitely uncomfy. (I should add that she was excited to see him this past time for the first evening we were there, by day two, she was nervous about him and his place again.)

I've came to terms with her never being the kind of dog that is fine with strangers petting her and most people accept it when I tell them she's skittish and won't let them touch her, but I do wish I could take her on outings without needing to focus so much attention on everyone and everything that's happening at once, because while I don't think she'll bite, I also don't want to set her up for failure either.

Am I doing mostly what I can here and just have to wait/hope for her to come around to new experiences a bit more? Or is there something else I can add in that will help?

207,1669149452,self.DogAdvice,True,"My parents are both in their upper 60s and have a Soft-Coated Wheaton terrier (about 60 lbs) who is extremely willful. They have a shock collar on him, but he typically isn't deterred from bad behaviors due to inconsistent conditioning and probably sheer carelessness to just do what he wants. My 4.5 year old nephew is growing a bit scared of him, as the dog constantly barks and lurches toward him when my parents are babysitting. My nephew isn't scared when he's sitting with my parents in a chair, even if the dog is sniffing and licking his feet. The dog will constantly follow around my parents if they are carrying my nephew, sometimes jumping up to smell or lick my nephew. My nephew is at the age where he wants to run around our house with toys creating a ton of ruckus. This agitates/excites the dog. My parents have gates around the house which successfully sequester the dog and nephew. However, this usually leads to the dog watching right at the gate door (or running in between gate doors if my nephew is running around), incessantly barking until my nephew fully leaves the house.

(Picture: Snoopy is the big boy, Annie is the little lady!) 

my family and i are fostering (soon to adopt) a senior beagle, he’s 11, and his name is allegedly  “Snoopy.” unfortunately we have little to no information on him, all we know is that his previous owner passed away and the family of the owner wanted to euthanize him. however, in their care, they neutered him at 10 years old. that is all we know about him. from our experience, he is VERY affectionate, he is overweight, he has severe separation anxiety, and he does not respond to his name/commands/sounds. 

we took him to VetCo (petco’s vet, we do not recommend) because we weren’t able to get him into our personal vet yet. anyways, after weeks with that vet, we finally switched and got him into our personal vet. our vet was concerned about Cushing’s disease, and the previous vet had mentioned it too.. because he checks off all the boxes on the symptoms. on top of that, he has chronic ear infections, hearing loss, a heart murmur, and a distant heartbeat (vet said that it’s hard to hear it? it sounds far away… possibly due to him panting  or obesity). we will also have to do a chest X-ray to ensure his lungs and heart are alright. 

i love this dog, he is the sweetest. we put down about $600 or more in vet bills so far, and we plan to put down more to get him tested for Cushing’s disease and X-ray. once they test him, we can get the medication to help give him a quality of life. we are also giving him CBD oil 1-2x daily to help him calm down because his anxiety. 

it just saddens me, knowing that we are going to adopt a dog who’s already a senior, and who’s life could be cut short due to a variety of different reasons. i am also sad because we have another senior beagle, Annie, who is 14 years old too. i know that beagles life expectancy is usually 12-15 years… and my heart breaks just to think about this all.",1,my senior foster pup might have cushings disease (i think he 100% does..),image,393,"['senior', 'foster', 'pup', 'might', 'cushing', 'disease', 'think', '100', 'guess', 'discussion', 'im', 'open', 'advice', 'anyone', 'know', 'anything', 'experience', 'knowledge', 'picture', 'snoopy', 'big', 'boy', 'annie', 'little', 'lady', 'family', 'fostering', 'soon', 'adopt', 'senior', 'beagle', '11', 'name', 'allegedly', 'snoopy', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'information', 'know', 'previous', 'owner', 'passed', 'away', 'family', 'owner', 'wanted', 'euthanize', 'however', 'care', 'neutered', '10', 'year', 'old', 'know', 'experience', 'affectionate', 'overweight', 'severe', 'separation', 'anxiety', 'respond', 'namecommandssounds', 'took', 'vetco', 'petco', 'vet', 'recommend', 'able', 'get', 'personal', 'vet', 'yet', 'anyways', 'week', 'vet', 'finally', 'switched', 'got', 'personal', 'vet', 'vet', 'concerned', 'cushing', 'disease', 'previous', 'vet', 'mentioned', 'check', 'box', 'symptom', 'top', 'chronic', 'ear', 'infection', 'hearing', 'loss', 'heart', 'murmur', 'distant', 'heartbeat', 'vet', 'said', 'hard', 'hear', 'sound', 'far', 'away', 'possibly', 'due', 'panting', 'obesity', 'also', 'chest', 'xray', 'ensure', 'lung', 'heart', 'alright', 'love', 'dog', 'sweetest', 'put', '600', 'vet', 'bill', 'far', 'plan', 'put', 'get', 'tested', 'cushing', 'disease', 'xray', 'test', 'get', 'medication', 'help', 'give', 'quality', 'life', 'also', 'giving', 'cbd', 'oil', '12x', 'daily', 'help', 'calm', 'anxiety', 'saddens', 'knowing', 'going', 'adopt', 'dog', 'already', 'senior', 'life', 'could', 'cut', 'short', 'due', 'variety', 'different', 'reason', 'also', 'sad', 'another', 'senior', 'beagle', 'annie', '14', 'year', 'old', 'know', 'beagle', 'life', 'expectancy', 'usually', '1215', 'year', 'heart', 'break', 'think']",senior foster pup might cushing disease think  guess discussion im open anyone know anything experience knowledge picture snoopy big boy annie little lady family fostering soon adopt senior beagle  name allegedly snoopy unfortunately little information know previous owner passed away family owner wanted euthanize however care neutered  year old know experience affectionate overweight severe separation anxiety respond namecommandssounds took vetco petco vet recommend able get personal vet yet anyways week vet finally switched got personal vet vet concerned cushing disease previous vet mentioned check box symptom top chronic ear infection hearing loss heart murmur distant heartbeat vet said hard hear sound far away possibly due panting obesity also chest xray ensure lung heart alright love sweetest put  vet bill far plan put get tested cushing disease xray test get medication help give quality life also giving cbd oil x daily help calm anxiety saddens knowing going adopt already senior life could cut short due variety different reason also sad another senior beagle annie  year old know beagle life expectancy usually  year heart break think

We took her to a vet who gave some medication which showed some improvement until it ran out. We took her to another vet who did a full physical and suspected a collapsed trachea but wanted to do some X-rays first. Apparently there’s a mass on her lung which she says is not cancerous (not sure what indicates that on an X-ray) but she doesn’t know what it could be so she’s going to start her on medication and see how that goes before investigating any further.

Other than the coughing she is perfectly healthy, happy and has not acted abnormal at all. She’s very cheery and super friendly, and the vet said her physical exam was perfect.

214,1669143287,self.DogAdvice,True,"My English Springer Spaniel Roxy (8 years old, female) has been having ongoing digestive issues for about 2 months now. We've been back and forth to the vet many times. This all started around September 25th.

It started out as painful gas. She would cry and pace for an hour to 2 hours. Eventually I'd get her to settle, put the heating pad on her belly and she would pass some really smelly farts and then just go to sleep. It was progressively becoming more frequent so we knew she needed to get into the vet. We called the vet and the first appointment was 2 weeks out. But they prescribed us a probiotic and recommended trying Beano over the counter with dinner and told us to try a bland diet of Chicken and Rice in the meantime.

Then we finally went to her appointment and got her bloodwork and a stool sample analyzed. Stool sample was normal, bloodwork only showed her Phosphate level was a little low, not really conclusive of anything. Vet prescribed a prescription diet Purina Gastro EN and said we could also use Gas X whenever she had an episode. We were slowly transitioning to the new diet and things were looking better. We only had about 3 gas episodes during the transition rather than every single night and whenever an episode was coming on we would give her Gas X and it would resolve in a half hour. So we learned how to treat it, but not what's causing it.

We scheduled an abdominal ultrasound. We lost our last dog really suddenly and wanted to be sure this wasn't something serious. Meanwhile the day before the ultrasound we had almost finished transitioning to the new diet, but suddenly she has diarrhea. So we go back to chicken and rice. She fluctuated between bouts of bad diarrhea and semi solid stool, we are now on day 4 of diarrhea. We have tried fasting for 12 hours. Then small frequent meals of chicken and rice. On day 3 we also added a spoonful of pumpkin. Probiotics in the morning, beano at night. Today we returned to the vet for repeat bloodwork and they gave us Flagyl for the diarrhea. Meanwhile my dad and I also had terrible diarrhea as well. So it's possible that it's a diarrhea bug that we all caught and is actually a separate issue from the gas..

It's a huge relief that her ultrasound was normal and didn't show a tumor or anything. But I'm also frustrated that we have no real answers for what's going on with Roxy. She's lost 7 pounds. I'm frustrated that everyone just keeps telling me to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm frustrated that I called the vet over and over and Roxy had to have diarrhea for four days before someone finally prescribed something. I'm hopeful that we can get her stable and that this is a bug and all she needed was a different diet. I love this dog so much.. I'm exhausted. I've spent so many nights up with her with either diarrhea or gas. Everytime I take her out I'm so anxious that she's gonna have more diarrhea.",1,Ongoing Digestive Issues,text,534,"['ongoing', 'digestive', 'issue', 'english', 'springer', 'spaniel', 'roxy', '8', 'year', 'old', 'female', 'ongoing', 'digestive', 'issue', '2', 'month', 'weve', 'back', 'forth', 'vet', 'many', 'time', 'started', 'around', 'september', '25thit', 'started', 'painful', 'gas', 'would', 'cry', 'pace', 'hour', '2', 'hour', 'eventually', 'id', 'get', 'settle', 'put', 'heating', 'pad', 'belly', 'would', 'pas', 'really', 'smelly', 'fart', 'go', 'sleep', 'progressively', 'becoming', 'frequent', 'knew', 'needed', 'get', 'vet', 'called', 'vet', 'first', 'appointment', '2', 'week', 'prescribed', 'u', 'probiotic', 'recommended', 'trying', 'beano', 'counter', 'dinner', 'told', 'u', 'try', 'bland', 'diet', 'chicken', 'rice', 'meantimethen', 'finally', 'went', 'appointment', 'got', 'bloodwork', 'stool', 'sample', 'analyzed', 'stool', 'sample', 'normal', 'bloodwork', 'showed', 'phosphate', 'level', 'little', 'low', 'really', 'conclusive', 'anything', 'vet', 'prescribed', 'prescription', 'diet', 'purina', 'gastro', 'en', 'said', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'gas', 'x', 'whenever', 'episode', 'slowly', 'transitioning', 'new', 'diet', 'thing', 'looking', 'better', '3', 'gas', 'episode', 'transition', 'rather', 'every', 'single', 'night', 'whenever', 'episode', 'coming', 'would', 'give', 'gas', 'x', 'would', 'resolve', 'half', 'hour', 'learned', 'treat', 'whats', 'causing', 'itwe', 'scheduled', 'abdominal', 'ultrasound', 'lost', 'last', 'dog', 'really', 'suddenly', 'wanted', 'sure', 'wasnt', 'something', 'serious', 'meanwhile', 'day', 'ultrasound', 'almost', 'finished', 'transitioning', 'new', 'diet', 'suddenly', 'diarrhea', 'go', 'back', 'chicken', 'rice', 'fluctuated', 'bout', 'bad', 'diarrhea', 'semi', 'solid', 'stool', 'day', '4', 'diarrhea', 'tried', 'fasting', '12', 'hour', 'small', 'frequent', 'meal', 'chicken', 'rice', 'day', '3', 'also', 'added', 'spoonful', 'pumpkin', 'probiotic', 'morning', 'beano', 'night', 'today', 'returned', 'vet', 'repeat', 'bloodwork', 'gave', 'u', 'flagyl', 'diarrhea', 'meanwhile', 'dad', 'also', 'terrible', 'diarrhea', 'well', 'possible', 'diarrhea', 'bug', 'caught', 'actually', 'separate', 'issue', 'gasits', 'huge', 'relief', 'ultrasound', 'normal', 'didnt', 'show', 'tumor', 'anything', 'im', 'also', 'frustrated', 'real', 'answer', 'whats', 'going', 'roxy', 'shes', 'lost', '7', 'pound', 'im', 'frustrated', 'everyone', 'keep', 'telling', 'keep', 'im', 'im', 'frustrated', 'called', 'vet', 'roxy', 'diarrhea', 'four', 'day', 'someone', 'finally', 'prescribed', 'something', 'im', 'hopeful', 'get', 'stable', 'bug', 'needed', 'different', 'diet', 'love', 'dog', 'much', 'im', 'exhausted', 'ive', 'spent', 'many', 'night', 'either', 'diarrhea', 'gas', 'everytime', 'take', 'im', 'anxious', 'shes', 'gonna', 'diarrhea']",ongoing digestive issue english springer spaniel roxy  year old female ongoing digestive issue  month weve back forth vet many time started around september thit started painful gas would cry pace hour  hour eventually id get settle put heating pad belly would pas really smelly fart go sleep progressively becoming frequent knew needed get vet called vet first appointment  week prescribed u probiotic recommended trying beano counter dinner told u try bland diet chicken rice meantimethen finally went appointment got bloodwork stool sample analyzed stool sample normal bloodwork showed phosphate level little low really conclusive anything vet prescribed prescription diet purina gastro en said could also use gas x whenever episode slowly transitioning new diet thing looking better  gas episode transition rather every single night whenever episode coming would give gas x would resolve half hour learned treat whats causing itwe scheduled abdominal ultrasound lost last really suddenly wanted sure wasnt something serious meanwhile day ultrasound almost finished transitioning new diet suddenly diarrhea go back chicken rice fluctuated bout bad diarrhea semi solid stool day  diarrhea tried fasting  hour small frequent meal chicken rice day  also added spoonful pumpkin probiotic morning beano night today returned vet repeat bloodwork gave u flagyl diarrhea meanwhile dad also terrible diarrhea well possible diarrhea bug caught actually separate issue gasits huge relief ultrasound normal didnt show tumor anything im also frustrated real answer whats going roxy shes lost  pound im frustrated everyone keep telling keep im im frustrated called vet roxy diarrhea four day someone finally prescribed something im hopeful get stable bug needed different diet love much im exhausted ive spent many night either diarrhea gas everytime take im anxious shes gonna diarrhea

216,1669141587,self.DogAdvice,True,"We have recently adopted a second GSD from the shelter (\~2 months ago). At first, the dog (we named him Dog) was acclimating well, learning new tricks and easily house trained. Three weeks ago today, we noticed Dog start to spin while sniffing the ground (bi-directional) and let out a high pitch bark when he completed the turn (not tail chasing). This coincided with the installation of our sod grass that day as well as switching to a new food: Inukshuk. We have tried changing his food back to what he had before the switch to no avail (Orijen Original). A couple days before onset, he finished a month long regimen of Doxycycline for heartworms. Since then, and truly over the course of the first 1-2 days, the behavior has increased in frequency to nearly all day except when he is sleeping. If he goes outside, we cannot distract him from this behavior (balls/ physically trying to move him, etc), and he also pulls up clumps of grass during the spins with his mouth. We are afraid to let him outside because of the noise + destroying our new grass. Indoors, he also spins, yips, and licks the floor/drags his teeth on the flooring while spinning. Sometimes a ball will distract him indoors for a few minutes while he chews on it, but most often he will run to a ball or a toy and then spin cycle once he reaches the ball. He used to have a solid “come,” but he now ignores it while spin-cycling. His vocalizations have also increased to constant, be it whining anxiously or high-pitched yapping most hours of the day. For example, he used to be very calm/happy during a car ride, and you can see in the video I’ve attached anxious vocalizing.   


He is going to the vet next week for a blood panel + heartworm injection. We have called them a couple times about the spin-cycle, and their advice was to redirect, and we have been dedicated to doing so, but it’s nearly impossible at this point to really distract him from the spin-cycle at all, or at least distract him constantly all day. We fortunately both work from home, so we can rule out separation anxiety, and we have the capacity to work with him more than most would be able to. He does this in the crate as well, but instead of licking he digs at the pad.   


All of this is to say, we are desperate for any insights, hearing from those with similar experiences, or advice.

My small dog has HGE. I found out earlier yesterday when he came back from being outside and big drops of blood trailed behind him on the sheet of my bed, I went outside to look at his stool to see if something he ate cut him a little, but his stool looked like jam and was bloody diarrhea. 
I was able to take him to the vet for an emergency appointment and his was diagnosed with HGE which can be/if fatal. He is in a fair amount of pain which is breaking my heart. 
I don’t have the money to take him into the vet again for his treatment of an overnight stay to push IV’s into his body, antibiotics. Which will cost a total of $500. I usually would be able to pay for this but ran into some personal family emergencies that wiped me out.

235,1669093123,self.DogAdvice,True,"Obviously my dog is an outside dog. but she has separation anxiety, so she will bark when she wants attention. I train and get her tired and she barely barks during the day until its time to eat dinner. she sometimes wants it early it seems. Thats not the problem though, she is quieter than the other dogs in our neighborhood that are around us and the most behaved big/medium dog on leash.

problem: she likes being outside more than in her crate at night.

explain: when it was warmer i'd have to pet her and then she'd get up to come in and be just fine during the night in her kennel, i dont force her in, she just walks into it with guidence.

now that its cold, we obviously dont want her to freeze outside. she has a dog enclosure she can safely be in with access always to water, a bed, and an igloo. when we bring her in for the night, she goes in as usual and then after a few moments of letting us sleep she starts whinning and barking. at first you'd think ""she just needs water"" or ""she needs a potty break."" well we did both of those, she didnt take the water (when she was a pup she tended to have water at night when she barked which is why i trued it this time) and she went pee. we bring her back in and then a few minutes later she is barking again. we eventually put her outside in the doggy pen and she goes right to sleep on her outside bed, then she wakes up whinning a bit (i assume she forgot it was cold outside til she woke up) and then she goes into her kennel and sleeps the rest of the night perfectly fine.

if we have an anxiety collar from the vet on her, she is better at night inside.

we dont want her to be cold outside. so we prefer her to be inside, but in the last 2 days, she prefers outside. we are working on getting a heating dog bed for her so she isnt cold but it would be nice to know is warmer inside.

her anxiety collar lasts 1 month so after that we have to schedule another, in between those days we dont want to be kept up all night trying to calm her down.

clarify: We do NOT want her outside in the cold. *she* chooses it.

anything we could do?

note: she is 8 yrs old, a Rottweiler, and she has had past seizures due to a mold allergy (affected us too. we moved since then) so the vet said we gotta be careful of the anxiety meds. she had us try some and it gave her a seizure so we stopped and the anxiety collar works great, no seizures.",1,My dog likes outside more than inside,text,479,"['dog', 'like', 'outside', 'inside', 'obviously', 'dog', 'outside', 'dog', 'separation', 'anxiety', 'bark', 'want', 'attention', 'train', 'get', 'tired', 'barely', 'bark', 'day', 'time', 'eat', 'dinner', 'sometimes', 'want', 'early', 'seems', 'thats', 'problem', 'though', 'quieter', 'dog', 'neighborhood', 'around', 'u', 'behaved', 'bigmedium', 'dog', 'leashproblem', 'like', 'outside', 'crate', 'nightexplain', 'warmer', 'id', 'pet', 'shed', 'get', 'come', 'fine', 'night', 'kennel', 'dont', 'force', 'walk', 'guidencenow', 'cold', 'obviously', 'dont', 'want', 'freeze', 'outside', 'dog', 'enclosure', 'safely', 'access', 'always', 'water', 'bed', 'igloo', 'bring', 'night', 'go', 'usual', 'moment', 'letting', 'u', 'sleep', 'start', 'whinning', 'barking', 'first', 'youd', 'think', 'need', 'water', 'need', 'potty', 'break', 'well', 'didnt', 'take', 'water', 'pup', 'tended', 'water', 'night', 'barked', 'trued', 'time', 'went', 'pee', 'bring', 'back', 'minute', 'later', 'barking', 'eventually', 'put', 'outside', 'doggy', 'pen', 'go', 'right', 'sleep', 'outside', 'bed', 'wake', 'whinning', 'bit', 'assume', 'forgot', 'cold', 'outside', 'til', 'woke', 'go', 'kennel', 'sleep', 'rest', 'night', 'perfectly', 'fineif', 'anxiety', 'collar', 'vet', 'better', 'night', 'insidewe', 'dont', 'want', 'cold', 'outside', 'prefer', 'inside', 'last', '2', 'day', 'prefers', 'outside', 'working', 'getting', 'heating', 'dog', 'bed', 'isnt', 'cold', 'would', 'nice', 'know', 'warmer', 'insideher', 'anxiety', 'collar', 'last', '1', 'month', 'schedule', 'another', 'day', 'dont', 'want', 'kept', 'night', 'trying', 'calm', 'downclarify', 'want', 'outside', 'cold', 'chooses', 'itanything', 'could', 'donote', '8', 'yr', 'old', 'rottweiler', 'past', 'seizure', 'due', 'mold', 'allergy', 'affected', 'u', 'moved', 'since', 'vet', 'said', 'gotta', 'careful', 'anxiety', 'med', 'u', 'try', 'gave', 'seizure', 'stopped', 'anxiety', 'collar', 'work', 'great', 'seizure']",like outside inside obviously outside separation anxiety bark want attention train get tired barely bark day time eat dinner sometimes want early seems thats problem though quieter neighborhood around u behaved bigmedium leashproblem like outside crate nightexplain warmer id pet shed get come fine night kennel dont force walk guidencenow cold obviously dont want freeze outside enclosure safely access always water bed igloo bring night go usual moment letting u sleep start whinning barking first youd think need water need potty break well didnt take water pup tended water night barked trued time went pee bring back minute later barking eventually put outside doggy pen go right sleep outside bed wake whinning bit assume forgot cold outside til woke go kennel sleep rest night perfectly fineif anxiety collar vet better night insidewe dont want cold outside prefer inside last  day prefers outside working getting heating bed isnt cold would nice know warmer insideher anxiety collar last  month schedule another day dont want kept night trying calm downclarify want outside cold chooses itanything could donote  yr old rottweiler past seizure due mold allergy affected u moved since vet said gotta careful anxiety med u try gave seizure stopped anxiety collar work great seizure

241,1669083542,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello, I hope someone can help me or give me some advice.. 

I try to make it short and sum everything up.  

My dog is extremely dominant towards other dogs and horribly territorial, I really think that this is an extreme case. I adopted him over a year ago , he‘s 2 years old , castrated and 17 pounds (tiny) , don‘t know his breed, he‘s a mix, but really really beautiful and cute and looks like an angel actually but if he gets angry, he turns into a devil. 

The first months were horrible, he became more and more reactive, went totally crazy when we came close to other dogs, he barked at everything and got aggressive towards me in those moments of rage. I was so so desperate, we live in the city and there are so many dogs here, it was impossible to avoid them completely. Going on a walk with him was horrible, at home I spent my time watching videos and reading stuff etc, I was so exhausted.. i couldn‘t afford a dog trainer or anything so I had to do it on my own, I tried several stuff from counter conditioning, worked a lot with treats, in the end I did a mixture of everything and it got better with time.. 

so now I can go on a walk with him and actually enjoy it (at least most of the time). He gets alonh well with little dogs , females in general , he‘s extremely dominant though and also insecure, sometimes even anxious towards little dogs which is absurd, because when he see‘s a bigger male dog (not castrated worst case) he gets totally wild and its difficult for me to control him. 
In most cases I can handle him very well but there is particularly one dog which is his hate object nr 1 and he becomes this evil rage machine , it‘s really scary actually. I can‘t call it aggression because it doesn‘t describe it at all. In that state I cannot do much. I tell him to STOP It, try to make him sit, making eye contact , which works with other dogs that he doesn’t like but not with his hate objects (that one dog and especially huskies) Even when the dog is not in sight anymore he marks the ground like crazy , growling at the same time, raised hair from neck to tail… 

today we had this encounter in the morning, he went wild, I tried but couldn‘t control him, he bit me in the leg. I was so angry and so sad because I thought that we passed that shit already, it was a huge relapse. most people find it funny when he gets angry because he‘s little and cute , he always has this beauty bonus. In the first months I always tried to find excuses for this behaviour(he‘s traumatized etc , he was abandoned) but I think it‘s his extremely dominant attitude which has nothing to do with the past. On the other hand he‘s the cutest dog, he really is. 

What is really concerning for me is the level of rage and aggression , he goes from 0 to 10000, it also happened that he got along well with a dog and all of a sudden he got mad and attacked the other dog without any warning. He’s so unpredictable and I’m afraid that he could seriously harm another dog. Of course other owners find it funny because “cute little dog gets angry“ “don‘t worry, it‘s ok“.. no it‘s not. another big problem is the vet. We were three (!!!) people trying to control and hold him for one vaccine. I don‘t know what happens if he gets ill and needs treatment … even the vets said it to me “this is not normal. We have seen extrem cases of nervous and anxious dogs at the vet.“ 

I tried to get him used to a muzzle, we trained that but he gets paralized as soon as he wears it, he wouldn‘t move .. i don‘t think that wearing a muzzle is the solution, I wish it was. He also rejects any kind of collar, he turns into a depressed thing, he only wears a harness for walks. Don‘t know what he went through and why he hates other dogs so much. 
At home he‘s cute and I‘m happy with him, he sleeps at his place, no begging at the table (of course he tries but he goes back to his place when I tell him) , no destruction or aggression problems, he waits for my commando to start eating , no extrem barking only when excited for something.. one vet said to me that I should not give him affection, no petting, no cuddling, only one place for him, all rooms forbidden, basically only nos nos nos.. i mean, this is not the solution right? We have rules, like I wrote above, but I don‘t think that something would change for the better if I stopped petting him. 

I hope this wasn‘t too much.. it would be nice to hear other experiences , maybe someone knows something, I would appreciate that alot!

262,1669044749,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello, 

My dog (1.5 year old hound mix) has had on/off scabbing on the tip of his ear for the past few months. At first, I dismissed it as a simple nip from another dog that he plays with, but it seems to reoccur in the same location on the same ear. He is not an outdoor dog, and is up to date on all his vaccines and heartworm + tick meds. 

The spot is small, about 4-5mm across, and bleeds occasionally. When it is scabbed over, it is a hard, crystal-like feeling that is noticeable. Additionally, my dog yelps a bit if I handle the scab. 

I cleaned it up with soap and water, and got these pics: https://imgur.com/a/jqBodtL

However she doesn’t play fetch with any toy I tried, she doesn’t play with other toys she has, the two things she likes are dog parks (even then she is picky with the dogs there) or playing/running/walking with me. I usually walk her 3 miles a day and take her to the park for min an hour on top of that. However with winter coming up and daylight savings time, it’s now dark when we wake up and dark when I get home, I tried the dog park but there’s nobody there after sunset, and to top it off coyotes have been coming into the city and I’m scared to venture far in the dark. As it is, I can’t tire her and while she is a good girl and doesn’t destroy anything while I’m at work, I wanna make her as happy as possible and I see how full of energy she is on our walks.

So I finally caved in, did my research and found a good daycare. But I don’t know how to go about this. My dog and I have never been really apart, I occasionally ask friends to dogsit her but always at my place. She is very uncomfortable in new environments, twice we did sleepovers at a friend’s house and she was very agitated in the evening to go home, she even peed on the carpet and didn’t ‘speak to me’ the whole time. If we go on a day visit and I leave the room/house briefly (to go to the car for example) she barks and cries and tries her hardest to follow me. I know once she gets used to the daycare she’ll have a blast. As a puppy she had a lot of separation anxiety. So I don’t want to just take her to the daycare and leave her there and trigger something day 1. I don’t want her to feel abandoned. This is the primary reason I avoided daycares for the past 3 years.

265,1669040898,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi y’all! First time posting here. 

I have a 2.5 year old pug. Ever since the day we brought him home he’s “humped” normally once a day lol. He has a blanket that he likes to hump and he’s just always done it. Yes he still needs to be neutered, he’s never around other dogs but we still need to for health purposes. (I saw posts in a pug group about pugs somewhat commonly dying under anesthesia so I’m honestly just so scared.) Anyways, we went on a 4 day trip where we boarded him at the same place we always do, and he seems to do just fine there. Last time we picked him up, they told us he was humping his bed alot but this time they did not. We’ve now been back for 7 days and he has not humped his bed or blanket at all. Of course I suppose he could be doing it when I’m not home, but I’m home more often than not and he’s never seemed to desire the privacy before lol. All of his other behavior is normal (eating, peeing/pooping, playing etc) Obviously I’m not mad that this behavior has gone away, but I am worried and hoping it’s normal to just stop all of the sudden.

266,1669036502,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello, so I have a 30lb dog that lives in an apartment complex. He is generally sweet and well behaved but he is a territorial barker and doesn’t really understand why so many people live right outside of our house. He has never attempted to bite anyone but he can sound very scary when he barks. He will pull on the leash and bark. We have has a few run ins with the next door neighbor and us leaving at the exact same time because our doors are 2 feet apart. 

Anyways she is fed up and scared of him even though he’s never done anything- she is claiming he’s tried to bite her on multiple occasions and reporting animal control because she claims we have no control over him. In my opinion this is just a straight up lie, but I could imagine how an aggressive sounding dog that we are holding on the leash might seem like he’s “trying to bite” when he’s pulling towards you. We have introduced them in the past and he always tries to hide behind us when she gets close. 

Regardless though, I want to be a better neighbor and curb my dogs excessive barking and territorial attitude because I’m aware it’s obnoxious as hell for everyone. Currently we do some treat training where we calmly sit him down and close his mouth and give a treat when he settles down, but it is not working fast enough. I think a muzzle is probably appropriate at this point if only for us to look better as far as taking action with the situation.

267,1669034602,self.DogAdvice,True,"TL;DR leave my dog at an Airbnb close by, doggie daycare, or leave him at home but he’ll be alone for longer periods of time. 


Christmas is coming up and I’m still trying to figure out what would be the best way to take care of my dog while at family gatherings. Will be going to one family function on Christmas Eve, and another on Christmas Day. They are both close to each other, but far enough from my house that we will likely be staying over at my mom’s house for the two days.



My dog is quite well behaved when visiting other people, but can’t go to the Christmas Eve gathering because they have cats, and he can’t come to the Christmas Day because my sister has pretty bad allergies and a small baby, and is also scared of Coop a bit (he’s very sweet but very big and very hairy). I could probably fight to bring him but I don’t want my sister to be uncomfortable at Christmas.



Anyway, I’m not really sure what I’m going to do with my dog. He is really good 99% of the time, but will sometimes steal something and resource guard it, so I don’t feel comfortable leaving him at a daycare. We once got a friend to watch him for a week while we were on vacation and he was so bad, that my friend was literally scared of him and we had to get a family member pick him up midweek. (Had a different friend watch him once but that friend I guess was experienced with resource guarding so was able to handle it). But it seems like he acts up when he’s with unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. He usually is watched by my partners family when we go away (he grew up with them in that house so they never have any trouble) but they are going to be at the Christmas Eve gathering, and will have their own thing on Christmas Day. 



My mom has offered to watch him while we are away for Christmas Eve, but then I’ll still need to find somewhere for him to go on Christmas Day. 



Options are: I have booked a dog friendly Airbnb near my mom’s house that we could bring him to so we can easily go and visit / walk him a few times that day. Im just worried he will be really stressed in an unfamiliar house by himself and destroy something (he’s hasn’t had separation anxiety at our house). 



Or we leave him at our place and just go home each night but Coop will be by himself for two full days and I don’t think that’s really fair for him. 



There are also “doggie suites” in my mom’s area, sort of like a daycare, but alone. But you have to do a consultation as well as a “doggie daycare trial”, so we’d have to get that done before the holidays start. 



Ideally, my mom’s friend lives practically next door and we could potentially leave Coop there (she has a dog as well so it’s all dog proofed), but only if she is away for Christmas because while our dogs do get along, it’s still always a risk with two dogs in the same house. But it would be so nice if we could use her house because we could pop in and out super easily throughout the day and my family loves a Christmas walk.

270,1669026177,self.DogAdvice,True,"Last night around 1:30am, my friend and I found a pup wandering around outside, freezing cold, without a collar. We got her inside, fed and watered, a nice warm bath, and lots of pets and attention. She’s curled up, sleeping cozily now. 

I’ve never had a dog before… the largest animal I’ve had is a cat… and I don’t want to mess things up. So… help? 

I plan to take her to the vet tomorrow for a check up, and to see if she has one of those scanner ID chips implanted. If not, I’ll post flyers around my neighborhood to see if anyone is missing her. 

She was terrified, starving, and smelled like stale urine when we found her. And she’s got a kind of rust-colored rash under her neck where a collar should’ve been. She hasn’t really made any noise, and is incredibly sweet. She stopped shaking from fear after the bath, and even managed to have some playful tippy taps when she met my cat (who is not amused). 

No idea what breed she is… see the Imgur album below.

She showed absolutely no signs of abuse until today. My boyfriend found a switch blade earlier that day. We we’re standing in the kitchen while he was cleaning and fixing the faulty button that would release the blade. He got it working and the blade popped out. This poor dog went from laying contently on the ground to staring and the blade. She sat and looked at it for a minute before getting up, peeing herself, then hiding behind the table. She was still staring at us while I took the knife and threw it away. I went to get paper towels to clean the pee and when I turned she had her tail tucked, licking the urine. Of course she didn’t get in trouble for doing this. I kept saying in a gentle voice “what’s wrong?” so she didn’t feel like she did something bad. She is fully house broken and has always scratched at the door when she needs to go out. I had my boyfriend lead her to another room while I cleaned so she didn’t lick it anymore.

276,1669010516,self.DogAdvice,True,"i dog sit at my home every now and then as a side hustle. i’ve recently started because i just moved into a home with a fenced in backyard. i have pet sitting insurance that i recently acquired as well. 
i’m watching my friends 2 dogs, 1 of which has known my dog for many years and they have played together a few times in the past. she asked me to watch her dogs while she goes out of town for holiday. 
earlier, i was supervising them in the backyard. they all have a similar energy level and play pretty rough. they were rolling around on top of each other, and suddenly one is bleeding profusely and i can’t tell from where. nothing malicious happened at all. turns out, the tip of the one dogs ear was cut, maybe from a nail or a tooth that was flailing around (like i said there was no malicious chomping action). dog ears are all veins and capillaries so the bleeding is intense and never ending. at first when i cleaned her up it was just a little nick, not even a CM long. she continued to fuss with it and shake her head every time i tried to clean it, thus opening it more, and eventually splitting it. i bought things to slow the bleeding and wrap it up, and put a cone on her. i’m taking her to the vet first thing in the morning and it’s going to cost me around $300. she’s not in any pain, seemingly, but i feel terrible. this has never happened before and it was a freak accident. i have kept the owner informed and she isn’t upset with me at all, she knows her dogs play rough and she mentioned she was surprised they hadn’t hurt each other before.

278,1669000374,self.DogAdvice,True,"
We have a four year old Shiba Inu named Chai. We have had him since he was 8 weeks old, and he is generally a very good boy. Of course, being a shiba, he has his ‘quirks,’ but when it comes to training and behavior, he has been a very good boy for four years now. 

He has also usually shown to be very adaptable. We have moved a couple of times since we got him, and he has also adapted through a lot of job/routine changing. He has always readjusted extremely quickly and well, honestly he’s really a trooper. 

But, out of nowhere ( for him ), he’s starting to act out. I’d like to ask you all to keep open and understanding minds as you read this! And know that I have years of experience with dog owning and training, and I know ‘objective’ solutions for some of the issues we’re having — im just a little stressed and overwhelmed and wondering if anyone has any constructive insight!

We recently moved again, about two months ago now. And in fact, the place we moved into provides a much nicer situation for Chai. And as he usually does, he adjusted very very quickly to the new place! He was doing amazing. 

Until I started my new job, about three weeks ago. Before this, I worked a full time job, and Chai was very used to being in a crate when I was at work — my new job is no different. 

But since the very first night after starting my new job, Chai has been whining in his crate. He has /never/, truly never, done that before. Not even a couple years ago when our life was extremely unstable and we had almost no routine. Now, we are stable, and we do have routine — but Chai seems to have almost regressed? 

Since my fiancé is at home most of the time, Chai pretty much only has to be crated at night. I wait until the last possible minute before I go to bed to put him in there, giving him as much time outside of the crate as I can. He usually doesn’t go to bed til at least 1 am. I’ll even stay up later than I should just for his sake, since he suddenly hates being in there so much. He whines immediately when he goes in, and goes on for about an hour or so. And then, he whines again at like five in the morning, and continues to do so off and on until I get up. 

I’ve tried getting up to let him go potty, and then locking him back up, and he’ll keep whining, so I know that isn’t the problem. 

And again, this only started when I started working again. For the first month in the new house, he didn’t make a peep in his crate, no fuss whatsoever — which is his normal. But now he’s not only keeping himself awake with the whining, but he’s disturbing our sleep too, and I work a very mentally and physically exhausting job — needless to say, I’m definitely getting frustrated and confused. And very tired lol. 

Today, he has absolutely blown my mind with a new ‘regression.’ We use the Place command for him for when we aren’t able to supervise him — if one of us is nearby and can keep sort of an eye on him, he does as he pleases. But when we’re preoccupied and in a different part of the house, we put him on Place. Just like with his crate, he has always been an extremely good boy for years about this. He has always seemed to even enjoy the routine, he gets excited to go on Place and he loves to curl up and snooze. 

But today, he has broken Place /four/ times in a row. The first time I wrote off as a fluke, thought maybe he needed to pee, but I still put him back on Place and released him myself, let him outside for a while, and then put him back. 

A few minutes later, I heard the clicking of his claws on the floor, and I was a little flabbergasted. He really /never/ does this. I put him back on Place. 

This has happened two more times. He doesn’t seem to be attempting to do anything specific when he gets up, like he isn’t going to the door to get out, he isn’t sniffing around the kitchen like he does when he’s hungry. He’s just trotting around or lying on the couch or something aimless. 

I know I’ve rambled on, and I know, being a dog group, people will have some most likely strong, owner-attacking opinions 💚 ( I’ve worked with dogs and dog people for over ten years, and I know how dog people are — especially on the internet! ) I just ask, again, that you guys try to understand that I know my dog, I know how to work with dogs, and I know logical solutions to these problems. I’m just struggling to understand where they’re coming from. I have never ever expected a ‘perfect’ dog, there’s no such thing, and I’ve always been very understanding of the misbehaviors he has normally has throughout his life. But these new things, his very sudden crate training and place training regressions, are important things and they’re very tiring. If this were a new dog, or a dog I didn’t know, or a dog who I know has had bad experiences with these things ( etc ), it would make a lot more sense to me. But Chai has only ever known crate and place training, and if anything, those two routines have been the more consistently stable things that he knows!",1,Four year old dog suddenly acting

289,1668989772,self.DogAdvice,True,"I've only had experience with an extremely reactive dog so I want to make sure I'm not overkill for this pup. And learn the difference between ""eh this is a minor issue I shouldn't micromanage"" and ""this is a real issue that should be tackled proactively."" 

We go on solo walks all the time and I introduce her to other people and other dogs. She's a little nervous around dogs but LOVES people. But sometimes she'll see (not meet) one person and just decide she doesn't like them. She doesn't pull or lunge. Just a clear sort of ""stay away from me"" bark. But it's so rare. Not even once a day that I'm confused on how to handle it. It's not even the same look, race, gender or clothing that sets her off though they trend more towards elderly women. And not even the same person every time. I've kinda of just let it slide as far as training. I apologize and we'll move to the side to let that person go through. Dogs are beings too right? They're gonna just not like someone sometimes like I do. But because she locks onto that person she doesn't like, it spooks them a bit. She'll do her one warning barking and then as they walk past she'll bark a 2-3 time more if I don't redirect her. Again, no lunging or anything. I often use treats to break her attention. But is that the best option? Because I am unsure how I can decrease her random, yet infrequent reactivity and make her more comfortable.

Final thing is her ""confirmation"" barking. She's otherwise very quiet and I live in an apartment. She sleeps in the bed with me and when I give her the command to come up to the bed at night, she does a single loud bark and comes over. Like a ""okay I hear you."" or ""On my way!"" thing. I'm worried it may wake up the neighbor in the middle of the night. During the day she doesn't confirmation bark like that. I don't get it.

294,1668986256,self.DogAdvice,True,"There is a very large family around the corner from my daughter’s house that got a large breed puppy about 6 months ago.

One side is chain link, and it is covered by a roof but still exposed to the elements due to the chain link side. 

My daughter and her GF tried speaking to the family there, but a language barrier prevented any meaningful dialogue, and they were eventually told to leave. They then called animal control, who came out and checked on the dog, and then told my daughter that because the dog had food, water, and shelter, and was not chained for extended periods of time that there was nothing they could do. 

I’ve walked past this poor animal while walking my daughter’s dog and it breaks my heart. He/she whines piteously and claws endlessly at the cement beneath the chain link gate.

However, mentally I am certain the dog is in unbearable anguish. It hurts me physically and I don’t know what to do.

295,1668985065,self.DogAdvice,True," Hi  everyone. I have a two-year-old lab. She's a wonderful dog. She was a  joy to train and i feel that I have very clear lines of communication  with her. She has a very balanced temperament (even though she was a  little timid in her first year) and handles 98 percent of interactions,  both with humans and dogs, very well. She has never bitten or shown  signs of aggression in any form other than what i describe below. She  also has a pretty rock solid recall. All in all, a very well-behaved and  good-natured lab. Not untypical.

However, lately a problem has emerged and i don't really understand what causing it or what to do about it when it happens.

I  should say firstly for context that i'm from the UK and this happens  while off lead in the park. In UK parks, it's generally permitted and  understood that dogs will be off lead. There are very few dog specific  parks. The park in question is very, very large.

In  short - Very occasionally, she will charge and bark at people. I know  that she would never attack, but of course the people on the receiving  end do not. She has a pretty scary bark and when she bares her teeth I  appreciate that she could be pretty frightening. She will charge and  stop 5 feet from them, take the space, hackles up and intensely bark a  few times and then return to me. It strikes me very much as 'get away  from us!'. When it happens, she ignores her 'Stop' command (which  usually makes her stop and sit immediately) and ignores her recall  command. This usually all happens in 5 seconds or so.

I've  noticed a few common triggers - People who are concealed and then  reveal themselves, for example, from behind a tree. Also people who are  behaving erratically. Occasionally (and hugely embarrassingly) people  whose faces are covered with veils. It also happens when people have bad  energies. For example, sometime i will spot someone a little physically  intimidating or something walking towards us and even though i don't   change my behaviour or signal my nervousness to her, she picks out the  same person and barks.

I think  there is a logic to it from her perspective. It seems pretty defensive  in nature. However, in my book, this is unacceptable and there is no  excuse. Especially to ignore her stop and recall commands.

Do any of you guys have any thoughts on what this new behaviour might be about and how to best deal with it when it occurs?

Thanks so much.

301,1668980253,self.DogAdvice,True,"Recently got a 2month old golden retriever, I have a 2 year old Bichon who is admittedly not socialized but is other wise very well behaved save for some of the basic commands we just never taught her. 

2 year old has never dealt with other pups besides her littermates, obviously. I don't know what her relationship was like with her mom or the backyard breeders we got her from.


2 month old comes from what seemed to be reputable breeders, they checked off most of the ""ethical breeder"" checklist. The breeder warned us that Golden is ""anti-social"" and likes to have her own space. She seemed worried we wouldn't like that and really encouraged us to get the other pup. 


Personally, I don't see any insecurity or aggressive habits in this new puppy. She is just a typical puppy with shark teeth and learning boundaries. She is quiet ""introverted"" , however, and regularly get irritated with our Bichon being too close. 


Bichon is usually high energy during playtime, darts around and wants to go hard. So for a while we had to remove *her* because she was overwhelming pup. 

Now, it's the Golden we have to keep separated from Bichon because all she wants to do is *bite*. My Bichon has completely kept a distance, sits with my husband or in another corner and is incredibly tolerant of Golden when she does get a hold of her tail or lip. 



They do want to play at times. But I feel like I can't let them because Bichon will just get bitten. It's like the first thing my Golden wants to do.. and I don't know that my Bichon has it in her to ""correct"" or teach bite inhibition because I can't let them play for longer than two seconds. 

My Bichon has actually gotten an *eye* infection because Golden always goes for the eyes.


Like, I don't think I can let them even sniff each other unless they are about to go to sleep. 

Am I hindering behavioral development and their relationship if I keep them separated at all times? My Bichon wouldn't hurt the Golden, I'm worried she'll lose an eye. 

I do try to play with Bichon separately but she is just SO obsessed with Golden that she won't play with me. 

What could I be doing wrong here? Should I just keep them separated until pup is older?

309,1668965326,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello all. Yesterday, my wife and I brought home a foster-to-adopt rescue. She is an 8-10 month old Anatolian Shepard who is 16 days post-op single rear leg amputation. She was found as a stray and transferred to the local SPCA where they determined her rear leg injury was irreparable and required amputation at the hip. We were told that they also performed a Spay procedure prior to the amputation. They did not send us home with any pain medication for her which I found odd, as I can only imagine she is still hurting. We did get Trazedone but from my understanding, that has no pain-killing effect and only serves to keep her calm. She has displayed anywhere from mild to moderate aggression towards my wife and one of our other dogs. All were seemingly random woth no common themes as to what would cause it. My wife tried adjusting her e-collar prior to bed and she gave a defensive bark and a attempted snap. That was the worse aggression display thus far with the other being mild towards my other dog. He will be minding his own business and she will start quietly growling as if she's just annoyed he's there. She has yet to show any aggression towards me or our other, oldest dog.

316,1668957863,i.redd.it,True,"Some context about my dog Buttercup who is the predominant cause for this post; she's a Pitbull-Boxer mix with some other stuff in there somewhere, about 6~7yrs old, and the sweetest dog ever when it comes to people, other dogs, and cats. We've had her since she was 2yrs old and she was a mommy before we adopted her.

Her favorite game is playing Tug of War, especially when you get competitive and make her fight for it and play keep away. Ever since I've started playing Tug with her, (when I was 14 and we had just gotten her) to this day, I've slowly become more and more rough and competitive when playing with her. I don't mean that as in being mean to her, but rather, making it harder for her to ""win"" and play fighting. While playing, I'll frequently shove her around, pick her up and swing her via her holding onto the toy, and get her in face growling and wrestling with her. She has never ever intentionally HURT me while playing like this, only nipped at my hand accidentally or lightly (didn't break skin or truly BITE me) when I really deserved it.

I wanted to make this post because I'm wondering if it's safe to play with her like this. Soon as we stop playing, she'll be sweet and gentle as always, and she seems to genuinely enjoy the rough housing and competition. But is there any chance playing with her like this could be teaching her to be aggressive, even when it seems like she's having fun and still sweet as always? And I'm also concerned if there's any chance giving her a tough time and doing stuff like swinging her up into the air while she holds onto the toy has any chance of causing any serious harm to her neck, teeth or spine. I love playing rough with her and me and her both seem to genuinely enjoy it, but if it might hurt her or cause her to become aggressive I'd like to tone it down.

We hike a lot on trails is wooded parks. Sometimes he gets these in his fur and I have to get them off. Otherwise he chews at them. Our house has natural wooded areas he uses to do his business. I think he sees these pods and thinks they’re treats or something. I have been observing him and see him nip at a plant and then chewing. He’s so fast! I’ve yet to see him actually eat one for sure.

I have two dogs of working breed. I have had them since they were 3 months old and raised them to be very social at the dog park. They did well socially but earlier this year they spent about 6 months with my dad's dog who would chew them up and bully them. Since getting them back, they are very quick to snap if other dogs get into their face and try to bite strangers patting them on the lead.

These are behaviours they didn't used to display. I think they've experienced trauma and I want to help them get comfortable with greeting new dogs again.

332,1668933192,self.DogAdvice,True,"Apologies for the long post. My dog (14 month old Romanian rescue) is constantly over threshold when outside, as in he will bark at nothing, whine, lunge and growl on a constant basis. He’s aggressive towards dogs and people. No aggression issues with visitors to the home. Generally speaking, he’s content in the home (apart from barking). I’m not exaggerating when I say he will spin and bark at the top of his lungs at nothing. I understand he will smell things I can’t but this is 80% of the time outside. 

Neurological condition: I got him at 6 months old but was unaware he was suffering from a spinal subluxation - before the vets thought attacks were “anxiety” - he was hospitalised, had spinal surgery, crate rested for three months. I’ve taught him to walk and do all of his basic functions again. Last month he was discharged from the neurologist and physiotherapist. No brain damage has occurred, only neurological deficit is his mild ataxia. 50% of the time I’ve had him he’s not been allowed outside. 

I’ve worked with a trainer and two behaviourists and have seen zero improvement. In fact, due to spending most of his time inside as he will immediately freak out, he’s worse. Both say he can’t meet other dogs without using graded exposure, but have people had success muzzling their dog and letting them meet a calm dog? He used to live with dogs in Romania but now he can’t see/smell one without wanting to kill it. 

Medication: is on gabapentin and fluoxetine, no change from either. Vet wants to prescribe trazodone but has admitted they have no idea. Seems weird to me because he’s ataxic. I live in UK and have been told Zoloft is seldom used. We use diazepam occasionally but limited impact. Do people have positive experiences with Zoloft ? Considering a veterinary behaviourist but we’ve spent over £15,000 on vet bills. It’s absurd.

I’m attempting to contact other behaviourists but all say the same thing: do gradual graded exposure. Yes, in theory that’s great, but there’s no starting point. The others suggest using a muzzle to shut his mouth so he can’t bark and then click train (wtf is wrong with people) or using a collar for corrections. He can’t use a collar due to his surgical implant. 

If positive behaviourists don’t help, medication so far hasn’t helped and my vet/current behaviourist don’t know what to do, what is left? 

I live next to the beach so it’s a challenging area to control due to dog/foot traffic. I currently attempt training at stupid hours of the day in an attempt to avoid triggers, but he still barks at nothing. I love him so much but attempted to rehome him for his own good, I’ve even contacted specialists who run facilities for dogs who can’t be homed, all have said no because he would be bullied due to his condition. I know this isn’t a good environment for him but for understandable reasons people and organisations won’t take him. I feel forgotten. 

I’m constantly heartbroken and the last 8 months have made me severely depressed. I’m considering euthanasia but don’t want to do it. I saved his life and am his rock. 

Any suggestions, medication, behavioural, specific behaviourists in the Uk, or anything else really, is hugely appreciated.

333,1668930816,self.DogAdvice,True,"I didn’t see any rules saying i cant post this, but I understand if it gets deleted.  TW- mention of dog fight, wounds, injuries. 

I live with family, and we have 6 dogs total, 2 are mine, two belong to sibling a (sibling a doesn’t live with us but dogs are here), one belongs to sibling b, and one is my moms. One of sibling a’s dogs (dog a1) resource guards everything, (but mom refuses to feed dogs separately) and has gone after 4/5 of the other dogs, who did nothing in response. 

A few months ago, dog a1 went after one of my dogs. She ended up going after him and we had to take dog a1 to the vet. 

This morning, dog a1 went after my dog again, and we had to separate. Everything had calmed down, so we didnt crate either of them. My mom and I were sitting on the couch, and dog a1 was between us. My dog came walking by us and he tried to to after her again. My mom moved her arm in front of dog a1 and my dog bit my mom. It was a severe bite, and my mom ended up needing surgery. 

Where i live, i am able to self quarantine my dog, so she’ll be separated for ten days. Ive already arranged a foster for her after the quarantine is over (she was vaccinated in august so she is current), but what do i do from there? 

Sibling A hasnt lived in the house for almost a year but refuses to take her dogs. She lives in a pet friendly apartment and my mom paid her pet deposit. Dog a1 has had these issues for years, but no one has done anything to fix it or listens when i say his issues will only get worse as he gets older

The first day I brought the puppy home they were fighting for 8 hours and I had to take work off the next day cause i literally got no sleep with them. Since then the fighting is slowly getting to be less, but it is still fairly constant. 

Most of the time the fighting is playful. But after hours it still gets annoying. My older dog has gotten mean a couple times but that gets shut down immediately. Even after wearing each other out completely one of them will walk by the other and they start fighting all over again. 

I try separating them sometimes so they can get “breaks” but this is not realistic to do constantly. I will give them distractions like toys or kongs but as soon as they don’t want those anymore it’s back to the same thing. They wear each other out until they are basically passing out from exhaustion and falling asleep very easily. I just don’t know how they sleep for 20 mins and are back at it again. 

I know my older dog is doing this more out of showing his dominance and establishing that. The pup is usually just doing puppy things like nipping or being curious of the older dog which sets him off again.

347,1668902522,self.DogAdvice,True,"I’ve had my dog since he was 5, and he’s now 12. He’s a neutered Australian Shepherd (possibly mixed, but idk) and has always been very calm and not one to really play. He was a medical alert dog for his former elderly owner who passed away which is why I took him in. He was very under socialized and over weight, so it took a lot of training and attention to get him healthy and used to being around other dogs. He’s now very social, loves to walk and exercise, but again, doesn’t play with toys. I work from home, so every day we walk the beach and he gets a lot of mental and physical stimulation with me, my husband, and my kid. If I go anywhere, he usually comes with me, and only shows anxiety when I have to leave him. He loves everyone in the family, but he’s MY dog, and basically my shadow. I’d describe him as a Velcro dog.

Over the last few weeks, he has been getting really antsy in the evenings to the point where he will play with toys with me. It’s been really nice to see his playful side, since every time I think about him being 12 I get really sad, since I know Aussies usually live 13-15years. He has no current health issues and his vet says he’s in very good shape for his age.

Here’s the (possible) issue: when we get into playing, or when he sees me play with my daughter, he starts trying to hump me. He has never done this before to people or dogs. When we used to go to dog parks, he was always submissive. If I’m sitting on the floor he starts digging around my legs and eventually pulls my leg towards him and mounts up. Even when I move away he’ll keep humping the air until I scratch his back and then he kinda snaps out of it. I try to keep the playing to fetch, since any tug of war or wrestling type play gets him humping.

I’m the only does it to me, nobody else. My concern is that this behavior could be a result of a health issue or could lead to a more concerning behavioral issue.

350,1668896668,self.DogAdvice,True,"My neighbor has two  dogs -males, greek shepherds- who are always in the garden. He has a big garden and he has build a dog house for his dogs there.

So, the dogs seem to have a weird relationship with each other. One minute they're cuddling and the next they're fighting. It's very common for them to fight and it usually starts when something triggers them. They bark at a thing/animal/sound that triggered them and somehow they end up fighting pretty bad. I have talked to my neighbor about this and he seemed to consider it a normal thing like it's no big deal. 

Tonight I was walking my dog. Unfortunately, I can't avoid his house, so I have to pass by his dogs with my dog, who makes them bark, which sometimes leads them to fighting. Just like every time, when me and my dog passed by they both ran to the rails and started barking and then, they started fighting. One put the other down but I paid them no mind. I just moved on because I have seen them fighting before.

However, when my dog and I returned from our walk about 30 minutes later what I saw concerned me. One of the dogs, the one who was down, was still lying there and the other was standing on top of him doing nothing just standing there. When the one still standing saw us he ran to the rails to bark at us just as he usually does but the other did not move. The other dog kept laying there only moving his eyes to look around. When I walked closer, I saw blood on the side of his neck. I couldn't tell how bad the wound was because it was dark but the dog moving nothing but his eyes looking scared makes me believe it was quite bad. 

My neighbor is not home. He's usually away during the weekends and he returns on Monday or Tuesday. I have no way to contact him because I don't know his number and despite searching him on social media I couldn't find any profile matching his name and face (sounds creepy but I thought I could try reaching him on Facebook or something)

I went by his house 15 minutes ago. The wounded dog is still laying there and he now moves his head a little bit still looking very scared, while the other, the one that bit him, is lying next to him (it looks like he is protecting him/staying on his side but I am not expert). 

So, what do I do? Can I call anyone? The dogs are pretty aggressive to anyone trying to enter their territory, so I doubt anyone can approach them. I thought about calling the police but what if they put the dogs down? And if my neighbor finds out I called the police to his house while he was away, he is going to get angry and he is not a person one can reason with. 

I have contacted a group of volunteers who help dogs in my town but they haven't answered my messages yet. 

Is it possible the dog could die from the bite during the night? Should the dogs be separated? What am I supposed to do in cases like this? I feel helpless. Should I just contact the police and hope for the best?

357,1668884863,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello! I have and 11 1/2 year old great dane. Recently, he has been exhibiting a signs of deafness (not listening, excessively vocal). I originally thought he was just getting stubborn in his old age. However, over the past few weeks I started thinking he might be deaf because he wouldn't even notice when visitors were at the house. It seemed happen almost overnight. He went to the vet and she said there was some fluid in his ear and performed a hearing test (making a sound behind him with a chime?) which she said he didn't respond to. She said it was likely due to age. I wasn't the one who actually took him to the appointment so I'm not sure why nothing could be done regarding getting rid of the fluid or what it was from.

I feel like he can still hear to some degree though. If I say ""do you want to go for a walk?"" Or ""do you want to go for a ride?"" He gets attentive and turns his head to the side like he always has. This works even if he isn't looking at me. 

So does this mean he can still hear to some degree or is he detecting familiar vibrations? Like right now he is napping next to me and I said his name.. He seemed to twitch a little but didn't wake up.

364,1668874641,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello. I have a major dilemma here and maybe someone could give me insight on my thoughts to solve it. I would like to not have to rehome my dog by any means.  But. 

I am looking at starting a career change.  I’ve hit a sudden and unexpected brick wall in my life and things are about to change dramatically.  Where I currently work I take the dog to work with me.  She is almost never ever alone as she goes everywhere with me work or not.  This job is unexpectedly ending.  As a result I am looking at relocating to a new city, and starting a career as a plumber which is something I’ve wanted to get into.  Apprentices do not make much for the first or second year.  I’d be selling my home and besides apprentice salary, be living from the house sale until my monthly income gets higher and I’m once again in the green.  At which point I’d probably down payment a house with what I have left.  

The dilemma is that to keep the dog I am going to have to leave her home during the day.  I can probably spend the 200-300 a week hiring someone to come in halfway through the day and give her a walk.  I’d also walk or run her before and after work.  This would get expensive, but I could do it assuming by year two or 3 of apprenticeship my salary would increase and I’m not at a deficit each month.  Without the dog, I wouldn’t be in a deficit at all.  

But the money is only one thing I worry about.  The main thing is leaving her alone so much.   I hate the idea as she’s never spent much time alone.  There is a co worker currently who has a family with kids and a dog who might be open to taking her.   The dog absolutely loves this guy and she also loves kids and other dogs.  His wife is stay at home.   Kids are homeschooled.  She would have a good life.

We have noticed for the past month or so when we tell her to go outside for a pee before bed she has turned around and snapped if we attempted to touch her, so we don't touch her we just raise our voice and she relents and goes outside to pee. I felt awful when this happened as I never want to put her in a situation where she feels like she needs to bite, so I don't.

She's been going to the same groomer every month since we got her and they always say she has been difficult to groom and hates all of it, but never any aggression. I tried to help her by bathing her at home sometimes, using the hairdryer etc and she's great with me. I bring her with me into a small room in the house where she can't escape my hairdryer and I don't need to hold her or force anything. We play with toys while I dry her and she doesn't care.

Today they were trying to dry her, one person had the dryer and the other was holding her still and attempted to put a towel over her (apparently they do this to calm them but I've never heard of it). She 'freaked out', turned around and bit the groomer. She didn't break the skin but bit her quite hard.

I guess my question is - what should I do now to be responsible to her and to others? Can she be around my niece supervised? Should I avoid that groomers? Is it better to just groom her myself from now on?

Ive known my neighbour for a few years now and I've seen him and obviously heard him in the back yard with his own dog before she passed away, he's got a very kind heart towards animals but I am also confused at why my dog is acting strange.

We have a Deerhound x Staghound and my partner and I have started working similar hours so hes pretty much left at home for 8 hours alone instead of the original 2.5 hours and it has been stressing me out a bit. My neighbour offered to look after him during the day when we're not home which seems like the ideal scenario. His wife is sick so he doesnt get to leave the house a lot so the company is probably good for both of them.

I left him today for a couple of hours whilst i worked a half day for a bit of a trial period, gave my neighbour the run down and the do's/dont's and was on my way. Thanks for reading the rambling just wanted to clarify the situation and scenario. 

Home now and he seems to be acting a bit aloof and depressed. Is this normal? Have I just upset his routine? I think this will be a better routine in the long run.

390,1668820662,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi, I'm not totally sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice. I have a 5 year old female husky that I've had since she was 7 weeks old. Of course like most huskies she's pretty high energy, and has always chewed on and destroyed toys since I got her. Her favorites tend to be string toys (that I monitor bc she's bad about trying to eat the string), stuffed animals (that I get very rarely bc she destroys them so fast and makes a huge mess), and cardboard, which she mostly just likes tearing up.

Back at the end of July I made a big move. This was clearly pretty hard on my dog. I lived with someone else before and there was another dog in the house that we got when she was about 3 months old, a female border collie. This border collie lived with us and my husky for 3 years (we got her when my husky was 2). 

When I moved the border collie went with the other person. I moved into a much smaller place and simply could not handle two dogs right now, especially two high energy dogs. 

Not only has my husky become a lot more anxious and needy (she clings to me and follows me room to room, which she never did before. She's affectionate but never like this) but she basically won't touch her toys anymore. I even got her a stuffed animal when we got here and even now months later it's intact. She licks it sometimes but that's about it. 

She eats and drinks normally, was in total health last time i took her to the vet, she still loves to go on walks and play with other dogs when I can manage to get her to a dog park, but she will not touch her toys. 

The combination of the anxiety and lack of interest in toys has me a little worried since she hasn't gotten better in all this time. It also makes caring for her pretty difficult as she seems to struggle to entertain herself at all and wants attention from me, and especially exercise, 24/7. I do what I can but I have my own stuff to do, and quite frankly some days after having already walked her a few miles and trying to play with her (which she's not really up for at my apartment either) I don't have the energy or interest in more play time. 

I'm going to be in this apartment for a while longer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to what I could do to get her to actually play with her toys again. I've tried rotating her toys, tried getting her new things(new rope toy, stuffed animals, rubber ones) but the only ones she has any interest in are new bones, and even those she gets bored of pretty quickly. I can't exactly afford to just constantly buy her new bones she barely even makes a dent on anymore every week. 

I thought at first she just needed more time but we're coming up on 5 months now of this. I'm not sure what to do to help her.",1,Dog won't play with her toys anymore,text,551,"['dog', 'wont', 'play', 'toy', 'anymore', 'hi', 'im', 'totally', 'sure', 'appropriate', 'place', 'ask', 'im', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'advice', '5', 'year', 'old', 'female', 'husky', 'ive', 'since', '7', 'week', 'old', 'course', 'like', 'husky', 'shes', 'pretty', 'high', 'energy', 'always', 'chewed', 'destroyed', 'toy', 'since', 'got', 'favorite', 'tend', 'string', 'toy', 'monitor', 'bc', 'shes', 'bad', 'trying', 'eat', 'string', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'get', 'rarely', 'bc', 'destroys', 'fast', 'make', 'huge', 'mess', 'cardboard', 'mostly', 'like', 'tearing', 'upback', 'end', 'july', 'made', 'big', 'move', 'clearly', 'pretty', 'hard', 'dog', 'lived', 'someone', 'else', 'another', 'dog', 'house', 'got', '3', 'month', 'old', 'female', 'border', 'collie', 'border', 'collie', 'lived', 'u', 'husky', '3', 'year', 'got', 'husky', '2', 'moved', 'border', 'collie', 'went', 'person', 'moved', 'much', 'smaller', 'place', 'simply', 'could', 'handle', 'two', 'dog', 'right', 'especially', 'two', 'high', 'energy', 'dog', 'husky', 'become', 'lot', 'anxious', 'needy', 'cling', 'follows', 'room', 'room', 'never', 'shes', 'affectionate', 'never', 'like', 'basically', 'wont', 'touch', 'toy', 'anymore', 'even', 'got', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'got', 'even', 'month', 'later', 'intact', 'lick', 'sometimes', 'thats', 'eats', 'drink', 'normally', 'total', 'health', 'last', 'time', 'took', 'vet', 'still', 'love', 'go', 'walk', 'play', 'dog', 'manage', 'get', 'dog', 'park', 'touch', 'toy', 'combination', 'anxiety', 'lack', 'interest', 'toy', 'little', 'worried', 'since', 'hasnt', 'gotten', 'better', 'time', 'also', 'make', 'caring', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'seems', 'struggle', 'entertain', 'want', 'attention', 'especially', 'exercise', '247', 'stuff', 'quite', 'frankly', 'day', 'already', 'walked', 'mile', 'trying', 'play', 'shes', 'really', 'apartment', 'either', 'dont', 'energy', 'interest', 'play', 'time', 'im', 'going', 'apartment', 'longer', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'advice', 'could', 'get', 'actually', 'play', 'toy', 'ive', 'tried', 'rotating', 'toy', 'tried', 'getting', 'new', 'thingsnew', 'rope', 'toy', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'rubber', 'one', 'one', 'interest', 'new', 'bone', 'even', 'get', 'bored', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'cant', 'exactly', 'afford', 'constantly', 'buy', 'new', 'bone', 'barely', 'even', 'make', 'dent', 'anymore', 'every', 'week', 'thought', 'first', 'needed', 'time', 'coming', '5', 'month', 'im', 'sure', 'help']",wont play toy anymore hi im totally sure appropriate place ask im wondering anyone  year old female husky ive since  week old course like husky shes pretty high energy always chewed destroyed toy since got favorite tend string toy monitor bc shes bad trying eat string stuffed animal get rarely bc destroys fast make huge mess cardboard mostly like tearing upback end july made big move clearly pretty hard lived someone else another house got  month old female border collie border collie lived u husky  year got husky  moved border collie went person moved much smaller place simply could handle two right especially two high energy husky become lot anxious needy cling follows room room never shes affectionate never like basically wont touch toy anymore even got stuffed animal got even month later intact lick sometimes thats eats drink normally total health last time took vet still love go walk play manage get park touch toy combination anxiety lack interest toy little worried since hasnt gotten better time also make caring pretty difficult seems struggle entertain want attention especially exercise  stuff quite frankly day already walked mile trying play shes really apartment either dont energy interest play time im going apartment longer wondering anyone could get actually play toy ive tried rotating toy tried getting new thingsnew rope toy stuffed animal rubber one one interest new bone even get bored pretty quickly cant exactly afford constantly buy new bone barely even make dent anymore every week thought first needed time coming  month im sure help

392,1668813099,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi r/DogAdvice. My dog is a 2 year old neutered male corgi. He is a pretty vomit-y dog in general, so at first this didn't raise too many alarm bells (he has been to the vet for vomiting three times and they never could find a reason for it). For the past three days, he's been regurgitating some or all of his food a few minutes after eating. Not every time, but at least once per day. It's not always all of his food (sometimes it is) but 50-75%. He is pooping like normal, has plenty of energy, drinking normally, and doesn't seem lethargic at all. He is acting completely normal, other than the regurgitating. He also has a slow feeder, but I'm not sure if it's actually effective at slowing him down since it's the same bowl he's had since he was a puppy. We haven't changed anything in his diet or anything like that. He does have allergies and we give him Benedryl on days it's really bad, but he hasn't taken any for a week or so. We are going to try and find a vet that can take him before the holidays, but our normal vet is completely booked.

397,1668803569,self.DogAdvice,True,"So we adopted a shelter dog in 2019, she was fully potty trained, never made any accidents, knew tricks, etc. the only issue we faced was she had separation anxiety and she couldn’t be left home alone in a cage . 
We came home and  she had peed on herself, had saliva covering her body and her cage. So we never left her in a cage after that. 
Just recently we’ve noticed that whenever no one is home, even for an hour, she pee’s. It’s only in one area of our home and it’s ALOT of pee. We do let her outside before we leave but that never helps. She’s never done this before and has been left home alone countless times and this never was an issue. Like I said It’s only when she’s left alone for any period of time.

408,1668790863,self.DogAdvice,True,"This is going to be long, bear with me.
My bf has three dogs, two of which are large 9 month old picardy spaniels (littermates) who live in a 10x20 dog run (the other dog spends the day in his parents backyard). All of his dogs are outside dogs, but he allows one of his favorites to sleep inside every night. He has never had an indoor dog before. He got the two large Picardy’s as 8 week old puppies and pretty much put them immediately in the dog run. They haven’t been trained at all and they get minimal attention. They don’t even have a dog house big enough for one of them, let alone both. They bark constantly and they jump like crazy, especially if anyone is near the fence. (They get so wild to the point that I’m nervous they will hurt themselves.) He says they have plenty of toys but I’ve never seen them. He also tells me that he lets them out of the run and gives them lots of space to roam around a few times a week. I told him they should sleep inside, especially since his other dog gets to and he says “they’re fine” because all of his life he has had outside dogs and they were “fine”. We live in the south, so I get it, it’s not *that* cold, but it’s just not right, and surely cant be comfortable. I just think he has a totally different view on dogs. To me, he treats them like an accessory. Meanwhile, I have four dogs who are a little spoiled. Mine are all well trained and allowed on the couch with me and sleep in bed next to me. 
His excuse for not letting them inside is that they are dirty, smelly and very loud and unruly. I have told him several times that they’re just untrained so they don’t know any better and the solution to the problem is to train them. I was under the impression that as soon as they get trained, he will allow them to sleep inside, but it’s not looking that way. I asked him if he has looked into training them and he says he just wants to find a specific trainer who will prepare them for hunting. 
I told him they will get nowhere hunting without first learning basic obedience so it doesn’t matter. 
I just want these beautiful dogs to have a fulfilling, comfortable, and happy life. And I don’t think he realizes that the dogs being with him more (even just laying at his feet while watching TV in the evening) will build a bond and end up making him happier too. I just think that he has never had the opportunity to bond with a dog closely so he will never understand my point of view until he does. 
It’s just so sad to see them yelp and jump and whine for attention all the time. I hate that they are stuck in a tiny space and don’t even have a dog house. And it makes me so upset that he says “they’re fine” because they deserve so much better than “fine”. Seeing them bark and jump in their tiny space makes me cry every time.

And this is not even mentioning the ignorance of him putting these two siblings (M+F) together in the same enclosure for 9 straight months. I’m worried about littermate syndrome and possible inbreeding occurring. 

Is it wrong of me to try to convince him to make them indoor dogs? If not, how do I do it? I don’t want to guilt trip him all the time but I don’t know how to emphasize how important it is to me, especially as the temperature starts dropping. It’s so unfair to those wonderful dogs and it’s upsetting that he is unfazed by it. 

Advice?

411,1668782676,self.DogAdvice,True,"Essentially what the title says. I have a small 5lb senior chihuahua. She has congestive heart failure and her medication makes her have a lot of accidents. I’m tired of having to constantly wash rugs, blankets, sheets, beds, etc. I tried pee pads but she doesn’t understand them. I have bought disposable diapers but she easily takes them off. So, I bought cloth diapers with suspenders that require diaper inserts. She still somehow finds a way to take them off. However, when she does keep them on it seems like they leak anyway. The cloth diaper is always soaked and often I still find places where she completely peed on the carpet through her diaper. I’ve even bought two separate “waterproof” dog blankets to cover my bed and some of the floor. I’m seriously losing my mind from living in pee smell but it’s impossible for me to find all the places where the diaper fails or when she gets out of the diaper when I’m not home. 

Every diaper that I have found online has some review talking about how it isn’t actually leak proof because either it isn’t absorbent enough, or it spills over the leg holes. Blankets also have these types of reviews.

412,1668782026,self.DogAdvice,True,"So, the USA + any USA Airlines rules have made it practically impossible to fly home from Brazil to the USA that doesn't cost 6k to bring them home with me. SO I have found 1 airline that will still fly a dog under the plane with you that is a latin america airlines BUT They only fly into 2 cities, Miami or NY. My destination....New Mexico. SO, I need to rent a car to drive from Rio to Sao Paulo (8 hours). Then Fly the dogs from Sao Paulo to Miami strait flight, 8 hours, then rent a car from miami and drive to New Mexico....(30ish hours) This isn't a spur of the moment vacation or anything this is a change of countries for safety and my family. So there is just no...not leaving or not going. And this is my only way to bring my fur family with me and I am willing to do it....Any advice on how to acclimate and get the dogs ready for this trip in 2 months to make this as smooth as possible I'd really appreciate.

Mini Schnauzer has flown cross continental before from mexico to brazil. He's crate trained but deaf now...maybe a bonus because he won't hear all the plane noises? Also great in cars and long road trips. But I've never done....Cross country road trip with him.

Newer Member is 1 years old and very clingy and I've been working on his crate training, what I worry about is his separation anxiety that I've mostly worked on so I can leave the house anytime, But I don't know how he will take me leaving him at the airport. He's also good in cars but the only long trip he's been on is when we rescued him in the mountains and brought him home. He's also 2xs bigger then the mini schnauzer.

I'm a bit overwhelmed but I want them to be safe and comfortable and I want to buy things for the car, A) to protect it from dogs to hopefully not have to pay for detailing, and to keep them safe out of the crates (because both won't fit in a car without disassembly) And how to make this as easy of a transition for them because this is about to be a crap ton of change all at once.

For context we've got a labrador puppy who is 5 and a half months and two 4 year old cats. Everything had been going well, the relationship was progressing to the point where all three could be sleeping in the same room as one another as recently as yesterday. Puppy is always on a house line and is never allowed to chase the cats. Ever.

We got home yesterday evening and one of my cats (the more confident one!) now bolts out of the room whenever puppy comes in. I'm not sure what has happened but he's become petrified of him and it's making me so so sad.

Any ideas/tips what I can do to repair the relationship??? It was going so well and I'm heartbroken that our cat has had something happen that has scared him this much of our puppy.

We always clean it with an enzyme cleaner, and a fancy carpet-washing vacuum to be sure that it's thorough. As I said, it's at least once a day, but never at the same time. I get up at 5 AM Monday thru Friday to walk him, and most mornings it's dragging him out of bed just to get up (it's cold and he's a snuggly lazy boy who likes to stay next to us under the weighted blanket, lol). He goes and does his business and then back to bed while I get ready for work. My partner gets up around 8 AM, and sometimes finds that Mochi has gone again, not even a full 3 hours later! If it's a good morning though, we can almost be assured there's going to be a different time that day he decides to have his accident. My partner stays up nightly, between 1 to 2 AM almost every weekday, just to make sure he goes outside before bed!  


During the day, if Mochi has to go, he'll press the button. My partner works from home, so Mochi gets to go out regularly on a short schedule just to try and keep ahead of the accidents as best we can. This basically has lined up to be 5 AM, 8 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM, 10 PM, and 1 AM. We had discovered back when things were really bad with his accidents, Mochi wasn't getting put in his kennel (we call it his home when speaking to him) enough for nap times. When we started that, it helped immensely, but not completely. We feed him regularly, twice a day, with the same amount of recommended food in the morning between 8 and 10 AM (depending on if we slept in on the weekend), and then again around 6 PM (depending on when we've had dinner, as he knows to go into his home while we eat, and his dinner is right after). He has constant access to clean, running water from a tip-proof cat water fountain. He likes it because his ""sister"" (our black cat) likes it, and they're the best of friends.  


And honestly, the craziest thing is, he'll have a day of the week (sometimes a weekday, sometimes a weekend, but not typically more than 2 times a week) where he not only doesn't have an accident, but he won't even ask to go outside for what most deem a normal amount of time between his restroom breaks, 8 hours! And he'll have those days without anything else being different - his meals, his naps, play times with either us or his sister, etc. But no matter what we do, we literally cannot come up with what we can do to replicate those days.  


We've taken him to our vet, who has done x-rays and scans to see if his bladder is ""small"" or if there's any infection(s), but he's in perfect health, and even more so considering his breed! We've been told over and over since he was a puppy (idc what people say, he still is, okay!!) ""Don't worry, it'll pass, and he'll be trained before you know it,"" or ""Just keep at it, and he'll get it,"" or ""have you tried to reward him with treats while outside and after he goes potty,"" or ""make sure you take him out consistently/at the same time,"" and more. We've tried them all. He's not the first dog I've had, not the first dog that I got while on my own, and certainly not the first dog I've potty trained, whether in my family or on my own. But we're out of ideas, and we've gone through all the typical advice. This can't be his normal. He's such a good boy, and the biggest love bug you'd ever seen, and the greatest snuggler in the world. There's gotta be something we can do to help him be the bestest boy we know he is.

She is 11 weeks old and I haven’t been giving her any human food as she has had diarrhea, this is abnormal for me as my mom always gave our dogs little bits of human food and it never was an issue. 

I was eating some McDonald’s fries and since my other dogs love them I decided to give her a piece of one. It’s been about 30 minutes to an hour and she started gagging. It scared me because it sounded like an asthma attack and I thought she was choking or suffocating and she was laying in my arms asleep so it was really weird. She regurgitated the French fry and a few pieces of kibble. Anyone have puppy advice on what puppies can’t digest? 

I wanted to be strictly against giving into her begging but I just rescued her Saturday and French fries are my favorite so I thought she’d love to taste one for the first time too.

434,1668722265,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 5 year old Australian Cattle Dog mix boy and a 9 month old Poodle mix girl.

When my girl was younger and not potty trained, she was exclusively in a playpen in the kitchen. Gave her alone time everyday and it went okay. She wasn’t totally comfortable, but didn’t bark, cry, act upset etc. She basically just stared at the door.

After she got spayed around 6 months, and is now potty trained, I fully puppy proofed my bedroom and moved her in there. Not in the playpen, just stuck a baby gate at the door and let her free roam. Here’s the kicker, she has barrier frustration and is destroying the gate at the door. I try to give her alone time, but the barking and chewing commences as soon as I walk away. I leave her with toys and chews, but it’s not enough to engage her. 

I have a CTC, CPDT-KA, SAPro trainer, but it’s been little help. She says the two dogs play well together, but will never be able to be alone together because of their size differences (he’s about 70 pounds, she’s about 12 pounds). She recommends giving them 10-15 minutes a day supervised together without toys and then increasing the time. Which, cool but if she has barrier frustration and needs to be separated when I’m away, how do I do that? Now that she’s had freedom, she doesn’t care for her pen or crate anymore. Do I re-train her to go in her crate or playpen? Would half a day doggy daycare once a week help her be separated from me? Am I just a moron?! She can’t just free roam around my place because she steals his toys, steals whatever she can find, and just has no chill still. 

Sorry for my rambling, I’m just so frustrated and with US holidays coming up, and her not being able to be alone at all anymore I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: have two dogs of very different size. One is a puppy who has barrier frustration. Trainer says dogs can’t be alone unsupervised.

435,1668717742,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi all! So, we have 3 dogs and a cat, and they really haven't had to be alone for much time at all, aside from a couple hours to go to the movies or something. I work from home, and on weekends we take them \*everywhere\* we can (except for Kitty, because he hates traveling, so we try to limit needing to take him places).

So anyway, we have a Friendsgiving an hour away, and we haven't seen any of these friends since we moved this January, so I'm not sure how long we will be there, and it was really starting to stress me out thinking about leaving them for 4-5+ hours (especially our littlest, who is 12 lbs who has a tiny bladder and is super super attached to me), so I asked my younger sister (she's 21 and a senior at the university in town here - SUCH a good kid) if she'd be able to hang out at our house and hang out with them, let them out to potty, etc. I told her she could do whatever she wanted, sleep, study, netflix, etc, essentially just make herself at home. She agreed and said she's really excited to see them and spend time with them and I'm SO grateful for it. 

My big question is, how much would you pay for a pet/house sitter for 5-7 hours? Money is really tight for me right now, but I want to be sure to pay her fairly. Not only because I truly appreciate her help (especially on a Saturday when she probably definitely has offers to get turnt with her college friends), but also because I feel like as her older sister I feel like it's important to set a precedent in place to where she's expected to be paid fairly for her work. She and I have a lot of similarities and she's SUCH a sweetheart, but I spent a good amount of my 20s being essentially a doormat/happiness pump/people pleaser, and if I can help to set a different precedent for her, I'd really like to.

443,1668700657,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I'm a first time dog owner and I have some questions about winter care. Firstly I'll explain the weather in my area so it's easier to understand my concerns, here in Silesia we usually have no snow up until like mid December or even January, but it is very rainy and windy, and when the snow does appear it's VERY common to put salt/sand on the roads and sidewalks (it's also said that it's gonna be snowing a lot this year but they usually straight up lie so idk yet we'll see). 

Now as for my dog- she's 4 yo, weights 10.6 kg and is double coated.

Now as for the questions, first being- Do I buy her doggy shoes??? She already has some depigmentations going on on her paw pads because it's very cold (during the night it's below 0°C) and I don't know if it hurts her or is annoying? I've read the paw pads will get very dry during winter but nothing some beanie moisturizer can't fix but I'm not sure, there's also the topic of salt on ice which I know is painful for dogs to walk on.

Now the second question HOW DO I KNOW IF SHES COLD- I know! I know she's double coated and she's most likely NOT cold, but now that she's shedding, her coat is very thin and she's always very cold to touch after our walks so I thought maybe she's cold because of all that balding situation? Do you think I need to gear her up for winter or just leave her be with her beanie moisturizer???",1,Winter doggy care questions-,text,271,"['winter', 'doggy', 'care', 'question', 'im', 'first', 'time', 'dog', 'owner', 'question', 'winter', 'care', 'firstly', 'ill', 'explain', 'weather', 'area', 'easier', 'understand', 'concern', 'silesia', 'usually', 'snow', 'like', 'mid', 'december', 'even', 'january', 'rainy', 'windy', 'snow', 'appear', 'common', 'put', 'saltsand', 'road', 'sidewalk', 'also', 'said', 'gonna', 'snowing', 'lot', 'year', 'usually', 'straight', 'lie', 'idk', 'yet', 'well', 'see', 'dog', 'shes', '4', 'yo', 'weight', '106', 'kg', 'double', 'coatednow', 'question', 'first', 'buy', 'doggy', 'shoe', 'already', 'depigmentation', 'going', 'paw', 'pad', 'cold', 'night', '0', 'c', 'dont', 'know', 'hurt', 'annoying', 'ive', 'read', 'paw', 'pad', 'get', 'dry', 'winter', 'nothing', 'beanie', 'moisturizer', 'cant', 'fix', 'im', 'sure', 'there', 'also', 'topic', 'salt', 'ice', 'know', 'painful', 'dog', 'walk', 'onnow', 'second', 'question', 'know', 'shes', 'cold', 'know', 'know', 'shes', 'double', 'coated', 'shes', 'likely', 'cold', 'shes', 'shedding', 'coat', 'thin', 'shes', 'always', 'cold', 'touch', 'walk', 'thought', 'maybe', 'shes', 'cold', 'balding', 'situation', 'think', 'need', 'gear', 'winter', 'leave', 'beanie', 'moisturizer']",winter doggy care question im first time owner question winter care firstly ill explain weather area easier understand concern silesia usually snow like mid december even january rainy windy snow appear common put saltsand road sidewalk also said gonna snowing lot year usually straight lie idk yet well see shes  yo weight  kg double coatednow question first buy doggy shoe already depigmentation going paw pad cold night  c dont know hurt annoying ive read paw pad get dry winter nothing beanie moisturizer cant fix im sure there also topic salt ice know painful walk onnow second question know shes cold know know shes double coated shes likely cold shes shedding coat thin shes always cold touch walk thought maybe shes cold balding situation think need gear winter leave beanie moisturizer

450,1668661626,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hey, so i’ve never posted on reddit before, but i’m in need of some help 

I wasn’t sure whether to post this on here or somewhere else, but i figured this place was as good as any.

Onto the main reason for my post, i’m a minor (not going to say exact age) and i have three dogs. I’ve owned all of them since i was in elementary school, and i’ve been expected to care for them all on my own. This includes feeding, walking, cleaning, grooming, etc. And while my parents did help me sometimes, i’ve mostly been on my own. Due to this, my dogs have become very matted over the years. I’ve always managed to just shave off the mats myself, luckily without hurting them, but it takes a very long time, multiple days on some occasions. Recently one of my dogs has developed some really thick matts on all four of her legs, they’re so close to her skin that i’m too scared to try to cut them off. I tried asking my mom if i could take then to get shaved at a groomers, but she said that they’ll take my dog away if they find out she’s matted, and i really don’t want that. 

Will the groomers actually take her away? She’s not badly neglected, she’s clean and flea free, she just has some really bad matts on her legs. I have a job, so i can pay for a sedated groom if needed, i just don’t want my dog to be in pain anymore. 

I know that this is my fault, i haven’t been brushing her like i should have, there’s just so much going on in my life atm, so i keep putting off brushing her, but now it’s too late

When we found out he had it, we switched him to a low fat diet, but he’s gradually gotten more skinny until he ended up losing a quarter of his weight.

This stray was different he was very calm ,relaxed would just sit under my trailer and I began feeding him every morning . He slowly started getting energy because when he arrived he would lay under my moms car and not move no matter what . I had splash water on him for him to move so we could use the car. He was the nicest dog I’ve met even more so than my own dog and seemed to not need much except food . Well a couple came to pick him up cause they liked how calm he was and he is a beautiful dog  a German Shepherd. I have anxiety so I don’t work regular 5 day work week . I do odd jobs every now and then , I had 300 dollars I was saving up because I need a tooth pulled cause I have a cavity . Anyways I ended up wasting all my money on flea treatments for him and my yard because me and my neighbors got infested with fleas because he would lay under my house , it was really bad but o didn’t mind because I just wanted him to be healthy and clean so the couple would have no reason to not want him or put him out on the streets again. It was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders cause I really can’t handle responsibility or worries . The dog I own I love now but initially I took her in against my will because my brother was going to the army and I wanted her to be with ppl she knew rather than strangers. Im going off topic . 3 weeks ago my mom said the couple loved him and he was free in their fenced In yard. Being well taken care off I was so happy . Now unfortunately I found out today that he began to get aggressive. He ripped the neighbors cat to shreds apparently and they tried tying him up after that because when they would leave he would escape and try going with them , follow the woman everywhere. He didn’t want to be tied up though , would apparently pull very hard on his leash and trash around which I think is kind of normal if he hasn’t ever been tied up . But when they took him I put him on a leash and he was calm with them just stood or sat next to us. Apparently he ended up biting one of their children ! They told my mom that he escaped or was taken but I found out that they actually took him somewhere  else and abandoned him. They didn’t tell me cause they didn’t want me getting mad. Now I’m so confuse as to al that effort I put in and how calm and nice he was . To how everything turned out. I feel like things always turn out bad and that’s why I stay away from strays .

464,1668643888,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi everybody, so recently we adopted 2 dogs, a mom and son, they're pretty friendly towards people and relaxed overall. We are still adapting to the change since we only had a dog previously which was smaller although more aggressive.

The thing is these 2 are on the bigger side, the mom is like a mix of golden/lab and the son it's a husky mix. It's already quite the exercise going on a walk since they go crazy, they do relax and walk slowly after a bit but whenever a dog shows up, no matter what dog, the mom starts barking and does sound more aggressive, the son seems more playful because he even cries like if he wants to play. We don't let them of the leash since we don't know them yet and don't know if they could run away or cross the street, etc.

The problem is that sometimes I have to take them for a walk by myself and when they pull barking at another dog, between the 2 of them they do give me trouble holding them, once I already slipped and lost the leash of the son while in the middle of the street. Luckily there weren't any cars but I figured this could be an issue.

Also since we live in an apartment they sometimes make quite a bit of noise barking at the other dogs, so I want to see how to make them chill a little, any training tips are appreciated",1,"Pair of dogs bark at every dog they see on the street, how to make them chill?",text,264,"['pair', 'dog', 'bark', 'every', 'dog', 'see', 'street', 'make', 'chill', 'hi', 'everybody', 'recently', 'adopted', '2', 'dog', 'mom', 'son', 'theyre', 'pretty', 'friendly', 'towards', 'people', 'relaxed', 'overall', 'still', 'adapting', 'change', 'since', 'dog', 'previously', 'smaller', 'although', 'aggressivethe', 'thing', '2', 'bigger', 'side', 'mom', 'like', 'mix', 'goldenlab', 'son', 'husky', 'mix', 'already', 'quite', 'exercise', 'going', 'walk', 'since', 'go', 'crazy', 'relax', 'walk', 'slowly', 'bit', 'whenever', 'dog', 'show', 'matter', 'dog', 'mom', 'start', 'barking', 'sound', 'aggressive', 'son', 'seems', 'playful', 'even', 'cry', 'like', 'want', 'play', 'dont', 'let', 'leash', 'since', 'dont', 'know', 'yet', 'dont', 'know', 'could', 'run', 'away', 'cross', 'street', 'etcthe', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'take', 'walk', 'pull', 'barking', 'another', 'dog', '2', 'give', 'trouble', 'holding', 'already', 'slipped', 'lost', 'leash', 'son', 'middle', 'street', 'luckily', 'werent', 'car', 'figured', 'could', 'issuealso', 'since', 'live', 'apartment', 'sometimes', 'make', 'quite', 'bit', 'noise', 'barking', 'dog', 'want', 'see', 'make', 'chill', 'little', 'training', 'tip', 'appreciated']",pair bark every see street make chill hi everybody recently adopted  mom son theyre pretty friendly towards people relaxed overall still adapting change since previously smaller although aggressivethe thing  bigger side mom like mix goldenlab son husky mix already quite exercise going walk since go crazy relax walk slowly bit whenever show matter mom start barking sound aggressive son seems playful even cry like want play dont let leash since dont know yet dont know could run away cross street etcthe problem sometimes take walk pull barking another  give trouble holding already slipped lost leash son middle street luckily werent car figured could issuealso since live apartment sometimes make quite bit noise barking want see make chill little training tip appreciated

466,1668638945,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello there!

I have a senior dog who went completely blind very abruptly a few days ago. The vet diagnosed her with glaucoma and she is receiving treatment, but it seems as though the blindness is going to be permanent. 

Which brings me to the question: how can I safely prevent my dog from jumping onto my bed?

My bed is very high - I am an average height woman and the top of it is at hip-level for me. She has never had trouble jumping up, even after going blind - but getting down has been trickier. She is afraid to jump because she can't see the floor (and it's a long way down to be jumping blind) but she also panics if I try to pick her up to put her on the floor. While this is what I've been doing, it is stressful for her and she has snapped at me more than once - so I think it is in both of our best interest to not continue doing that. 

While she has also made the jump down a few times, I'm worried about the possibility that she'll hurt herself - either from the actual jump, or from hitting any of the nearby furniture. 

I've tried giving her a step - a solid piece of furniture to hop onto between the bed and floor - but even if I picked her up and put her on it, she wouldn't go from there to the bed and I also couldn't coax her from the bed onto the step. 

My bedroom unfortunately doesn't have a surplus of free space, so I don't have any room for a ramp that would be large enough for her - and I don't believe that she'd be inclined to use one.

I feel like the safest solution long-term would be to prevent her from getting onto the bed at all - she'll be sad, I'll be sad, but I won't have to worry about her breaking her neck jumping down into a bookshelf. She does have a pet bed right next to mine that she uses sometimes already, and I'm hoping to make that her permanent sleep spot. 

I've mostly been looking at things like toddler rails, but as this is my first experience with a blind dog and I've never actually used these sorts of rails before, I don't know if they'd be sufficient to stop a 40 pound dog from just barreling through or around them. Has anyone here tried this approach before, or are there better solutions?

She's a very stubborn dog, so unfortunately I don't think I could trust training alone for her (Chow mix) - and while she has a crate, it is in a different room and I don't think she'd like being confined to it at night.

467,1668638479,self.DogAdvice,True,"My cockapoo is struggling so so bad with itching. It's awful just before bed its like he's going nuts and as he sleeps with us it keeps us awake. The vet has ruled out that it's not food, he was prescribed flea treatment so it's not that and he is on apoquel allergy tablets and they don't work for shit.
Nothing in his environment has changed but we just don't know where to start eliminating to see what triggers it.
The emergency vet gave him an injection and steroids and they worked instantly just with bad side effects and he can't be on them long term. Our regular vets are quick to prescribe multiple tablets at a high cost. (my cats on 3! and none work)
He goes back tomorrow but the next step is a more expensive allergy medication and then allergy tests. They think it's seasonal but it's been bad since June. 

What are common things I can remove to see if it helps?
He's on limited ingredient diet. We avoided grass on his walks. Pretty sure it's not the detergent for the bedding. We avoid chicken treats and he's not getting half as many.

477,1668621659,self.DogAdvice,True,"Looking for advice on how to curb crying/whining and neediness in a dog.

Bit of dog background: he's a giant breed mix, I rescued him when he was 1. Horribly behaved then, unsocialised and untrained. He's now 4. Has come on in leaps and bounds, is crate trained, semi-social with other dogs and lead/house trained etc. Doing so well! He's mostly stopped jumping when people come into the house- he absolutely adores all people. 

Bit of situation background: He's always been quite needy, since I got him. It took ages for him to stop crying/destroying things when I left the house. We're down to about 2 or 3 barks and a bit of crying before he settles now (have checked cams). But I got him when I was single, and now I'm seeing someone quite seriously. We're spending time between both houses. 

Now, the dog absolutely adores my boyfriend, and the Ukrainian couple he's hosting at his house. But that's now 4 people to contend with, all with different schedules. When I'm not there during the day, they sometimes want him out of the way (when cooking etc  as he's counter height). They'll sometimes have him in a different room with his bed. 

The issue: he seems to be crying and whimpering nonstop when he's not with people, and being a big dog he produces very loud crying!

It has been only a week and honestly all my days evolve around him, even if I’m at work (like now lol) I am searching training tips or toys to get him.
Obviously since he’s a baby it has not been easy, my problem is that I live in a apartment with a roommate (I am planning on moving out soon so I don’t want my pup to get attached to them that much) and since it hasn’t been long since he got separated from his siblings and mom he hasn’t experienced being alone, and I am guilty of being with him almost 24h everyday since I got him…
Well I don’t know what to do to be honest, his playpen and crate stay in my room cause he’s my responsibility not my housemate (and they have their own pets too which also stay most of the time in their room) and every time I leave for work he just cries all night long ( I work night shifts). Honestly if it was just me I wouldn’t worry much cause I know i need to let him calm down by himself and give him time to get confident in being alone, but i’m worried about my housemate and my neighbors.

498,1668577627,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I have a Male 13 month old corgi heeler mix, he is neutered, crate trained and housebroken. But he does have a little bit of a naughty streak. Nothing crazy he just rips up stuffed toys if he’s given them and likes to counter surf (we are working on that).

When I say crate train I mean he’s very good about his crate he has had it and the bed in it since he was a puppy, and the only time he has ever had an accident in his crate is when we switched his dog food from puppy food to adult dog food and he had some tummy trouble. But it was thoroughly cleaned and that was months ago. 

He goes in there whenever we need to leave the house, so some days he’s in there for as much as five hours but that’s pretty rare, most of the time it’s for around two or three hour. He is very used to this routine and goes into the crate very willingly usually he immediately lays down to take a nap. 

But in the last week he has ripped up the bed in his crate and then today he destroyed the plastic crate mat. In both instances he wasn’t even in the crate for that long under four hours for both. 

I’m not sure what to do about it besides get a new crate mat, I don’t really want to spray the mat with the sour spray that we use for other things we want him to leave alone because I worry that it could hurt his nose being stuck so close to it.

499,1668574874,self.DogAdvice,True,"So this is a long story to type out - so sorry In advance for my poor grammar/spelling. Last year my family dog was stolen from our property. I live on a fairly big plot of land and my closest neighbor is 3 miles away. The last time my dog was seen, he was was in the presence of 4 women who were at my house because their husbands/brothers were working in my orchards. These women happen to be apart of a fairly big family who work on our land and are our closest neighbors. When he went missing I sent flyers everywhere, I made a report, I knocked on doors, I ask every worker if they knew anything, and posted on every social media/ lost dog site you could. Never heard anything back. About a week ago I was driving out of town (I always pass their house when leaving mine) and I saw what I believed to be my lost dog running out of their driveway.

I found out some of the names of the people who there and found a couple social media pages - looking to see if they posted a picture w him. I found one graining video that one of the women posted and briefly a dog who looks exactly like my lost dog pans into the video. I believe he is with them but I have no idea how to prove.

When we put him out the back and shut the screen door, it knight be to vaccum and mop or do something around the house, he sits at the back door instantly and starts whining and crying. 5 mins in, he will start trying to open the door or bite the door and this will just go on until she finally let's him in.

The back door is usually always open so he has access to outside and inside whenever he wants but when we need to get stuff done without tripping over him, we out him out the back and it's usually only for 30 minutes tops.

Because he's so big, when he claws the door he scratches it and damages the mesh sometimes.

The look on his face when he sits at the door is like he's in trouble or we are treating him poorly. 

Is there a way to reverse this being 7 years old?

My dog was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with pancreatitis. Initially he had liquid diarrhea on Friday night before vet visit on Monday and it stayed consistent and didn’t get better over the weekend. 

On the Monday he was diagnosed and given a drug (Cerenia) at the vet. I started him on Metronidazole for 7 days and FortiFlora for 10 days. All while on a bland diet. 

I had his 2 week check up and at the vet his blood panel still showed abnormal. Their machine only shows normal or abnormal. So we continued on with the bland diet for another week. X-Ray was negative on anything noticeable. 

Yesterday (week 3) his blood work still showed abnormal but I had them also send his blood out to get a number that could possibly show the severity of it, currently waiting for those results. 

His diarrhea stopped after the cerenia shot though it was still soft and messy just not liquidated.  He doesn’t throw up and seems more active and back to himself over time. The last week or so his poop is decently firm and looks normal. 

The weird this since this all started his gut or pancreas is super loud, like it’s very audible from like 10 feet away.

519,1668538982,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have an almost 5 year old corgi and have been strongly considering getting another one next year. The problem is that my dog is very jealous. She gets jealous when my boyfriend and I give each other affection. Either she’ll squeeze her way between us, nudge us until we either tell her to go on her pad or kennel or try to get in on the action with puppy kisses (which is not what you want to listen to or think about as you kiss your partner). She’ll even bark at us when we hug sometimes. We’re working on fixing these problems but progress is slow and I’m not exactly sure how to stop this behavior besides having her go to her pad and only giving her attention when I decide, not when she’s trying to get my attention. 

My boyfriends mom got a puppy recently and she HATES this poor creature. She never hurt it at all or was worryingly aggressive but she completely ignored it and snarled/intimidated/snapped at it when it came to her (and they were not left alone without supervision). The motherly instinct I hope would kick in was no where to be seen. This has obviously made me worry how she will behave with a new puppy around so I was wondering if anyone has navigated a similar situation or has any advice on how to curb this behavior in preparation to getting a puppy. 

I think it might be relevant to mention she was attacked by a small dog when she was a puppy. She’s got a little scar on her nose to prove it and has been wary around smaller dogs ever since. She’s very submissive around large dogs (even having been attacked by an off leash dog on a walk a year ago, although that encounter left no injuries and the dogs were quickly split apart) but gets nervous and more on guard around small ones.",1,I’m thinking about getting a puppy next year but I’m worried about my jealous dog,text,340,"['thinking', 'getting', 'puppy', 'next', 'year', 'worried', 'jealous', 'dog', 'almost', '5', 'year', 'old', 'corgi', 'strongly', 'considering', 'getting', 'another', 'one', 'next', 'year', 'problem', 'dog', 'jealous', 'get', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'give', 'affection', 'either', 'squeeze', 'way', 'u', 'nudge', 'u', 'either', 'tell', 'go', 'pad', 'kennel', 'try', 'get', 'action', 'puppy', 'kiss', 'want', 'listen', 'think', 'kiss', 'partner', 'even', 'bark', 'u', 'hug', 'sometimes', 'working', 'fixing', 'problem', 'progress', 'slow', 'exactly', 'sure', 'stop', 'behavior', 'besides', 'go', 'pad', 'giving', 'attention', 'decide', 'trying', 'get', 'attention', 'boyfriend', 'mom', 'got', 'puppy', 'recently', 'hate', 'poor', 'creature', 'never', 'hurt', 'worryingly', 'aggressive', 'completely', 'ignored', 'snarledintimidatedsnapped', 'came', 'left', 'alone', 'without', 'supervision', 'motherly', 'instinct', 'hope', 'would', 'kick', 'seen', 'obviously', 'made', 'worry', 'behave', 'new', 'puppy', 'around', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'navigated', 'similar', 'situation', 'advice', 'curb', 'behavior', 'preparation', 'getting', 'puppy', 'think', 'might', 'relevant', 'mention', 'attacked', 'small', 'dog', 'puppy', 'got', 'little', 'scar', 'nose', 'prove', 'wary', 'around', 'smaller', 'dog', 'ever', 'since', 'submissive', 'around', 'large', 'dog', 'even', 'attacked', 'leash', 'dog', 'walk', 'year', 'ago', 'although', 'encounter', 'left', 'injury', 'dog', 'quickly', 'split', 'apart', 'get', 'nervous', 'guard', 'around', 'small', 'one']",thinking getting puppy next year worried jealous almost  year old corgi strongly considering getting another one next year problem jealous get jealous boyfriend give affection either squeeze way u nudge u either tell go pad kennel try get action puppy kiss want listen think kiss partner even bark u hug sometimes working fixing problem progress slow exactly sure stop behavior besides go pad giving attention decide trying get attention boyfriend mom got puppy recently hate poor creature never hurt worryingly aggressive completely ignored snarledintimidatedsnapped came left alone without supervision motherly instinct hope would kick seen obviously made worry behave new puppy around wondering anyone navigated similar situation curb behavior preparation getting puppy think might relevant mention attacked small puppy got little scar nose prove wary around smaller ever since submissive around large even attacked leash walk year ago although encounter left injury quickly split apart get nervous guard around small one

521,1668534454,self.DogAdvice,True,"Just brought home a 1-year-old Border Collie mix who recently gave birth and was spayed. She loves people and (most) other dogs. There's one habit we're trying to work on - she jumps up as a greeting.

We're going to engage a trainer shortly but would love to hear anything that worked with your pup. She's about 50 lbs so her jumping could at some point hurt someone (though I don't think she means to). She's REALLY high-energy (which can be a little scary in and of itself). If she jumps on me while I'm standing I'll just calmly walk away and do something else. If she does it while I'm sitting, I can push her off (gently) but I have to keep petting her or she tries it again. She's very demanding about affection, which is sweet ... at first. But I can't type at the computer or look at my phone as she aggressively nudges my arm to pet her again.

I'm torn between wanting to give her lots of pats and attention (because of all she's been through, to reassure her) and thinking I'm maybe encouraging some of her behavior.

I suspect when we start working a trainer and come up with some training ""games"" she'll have a place to put some of that energy. She gets multiple walks during the day (some a mile or so) and we'll be taking her to a local dog run to get some of that energy out as well. But it's sometimes a little scary how needy and demanding she is. My prior dog was terrified of everything when we first adopted him, so all our work was to get him out of his shell.

525,1668529071,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog is a whole mix of breeds (Staffordshire pit, tree walking coonhound, and lab are the main ones). He’s about 1.5 years old and has always been a very good eater. So much so that when he was a pup we used a slow feeder. 

Recently, he had this mass on his foot that got very red and infected. We took him to the vet and they gave us antibiotics and anti inflammatory pills. He hates the pills (they smell like a fart) and we’ve been shoving them down his throat for about a month now after every meal. The mass on his foot is almost gone (just some scabbing/scar tissue left), but for the last couple of days he’s been completely uninterested in his breakfast or dinner. He still takes treats and snacks but just licks all the kibble in his bowl during meals. I have to hand feed him the food because he has to take the pills with food in his stomach. 

So I’m wondering if the reason my dog isn’t eating is because he’s now associated meal time with getting 3 pills shoved down his throat. The pills run out tomorrow morning and the vet doesn’t want to see him unless the bump on his paw comes back.

For the sake of brevity I’ll leave all the details out but happy to provide any that may be helpful. But every few month we were having episodes of gastroenteritis that would land him at the emergency vet. A recent episode evolved into HGE and then this most recent one just started as HGE

I understand they cause isn’t really known but the vet said with as often as these episodes are happening there has to be some underlying condition. We did all the blood panels - all came back in acceptable ranges. We are now trying a strict diet. Essentially just hydrolized protein food. No treats at all. I have no way to know if it’s working. If he has another episode in a couple of months it’s not. Otherwise it may be. The only other test she has mentioned is a ultrasound to check the thickness of intestinal lining. The only other I can think it maybe running high stress is a contributing factor. He has been on a calming probiotic for quite some time.

543,1668488278,self.DogAdvice,True,"I’m taking her to the vet again tomorrow so I’m not looking for any kind of diagnosis.  Just wondering if anyone here might have suggestions of what could be happening or anything to ask the vet about.  Yes, I know google exists, but I’m trying to avoid some panic scrolling and vague articles.

Context:
The first time she had blood was a few years ago and the tests showed that she had struvite crystals in her bladder.  We put her on an Rx diet - Royal Canin Urinary SO - which did the trick until we moved and it was difficult to get an Rx from her new vet as her X-rays didn’t show any crystals.
She was fine for a while until a few months ago when she started bleeding again.  We had X-rays and a urinalysis done, but there were neither crystals nor bacteria found.  The vet put her on a round of a general antibiotic -  Clavamox - and everything seemed fine.
That is, until today when she had an accident in the house and there was a considerable amount of blood.

She is about 4.5-5 years old, Pit mix, vaccinated.

545,1668484839,self.DogAdvice,True,"my dog, 11yr male shih-tzu…his name is rudy and he’s my best friend. rudy was not neutered and this caused an excess of testosterone to cause unnatural growth (apocrine gland adenocarcinoma - cancer) to form in place of his anal sacs. his condition is extremely bad, as the tumors have ulcerated all around his anus. undoubtedly causing pain for him. we keep a ‘cone’ on him nearly at all times so that he does not lick his behind. we have bought cheap blankets to cover every surface with so rudy can go on our beds without getting blood everywhere. 

my father didn’t want to go to the vet because he knew how expensive it would be. we went to the vet in 2020 and they told us they would have to do major surgery to his anal region, and there was major chance with rudy’s age at the time already that rudy would lose complete function of his anus and bowel movements. also a nervousness about sending rudy through a major surgery with his heart murmur and his age. this surgery would cost $7,000. my dad refused, and cried on the way home

my dad has a habit of empathizing with rudy, saying “his ass must hurt” and “poor guy”. when i say that we could do something about it, such as start looking around for other vets and second and third opinions- he refuses, saying it will be a waste. it is my impression that he has given up on rudy’s chance of a better life.

562,1668453624,self.DogAdvice,True,"My 4 yo Blue-Heeler/Shepherd/Lab mix had her first litter (with an Aussie we chose). We are keeping two pups from the litter and have a third for a family member we have held onto until we can travel to them. 

Mom has done alright with the litter, does't like them as we thought she would (she's been VERY maternal towards human babies). For context, she's a very gentle and patient alpha, and has done very well with other's puppies. When she's needed to set boundaries she does a great job at communicating with other dogs and the puppies before doing anything physical like nipping. 

Our puppies play hard, sometimes I'm concerned a little too aggressively, and recently Mom has started nibbling on her puppies when they're playing. She's done it for a bit outside of them playing, nibbling on their chest or neck (cobbing I guess its called). Recently, however, she has started doing it while they're playing, and started biting (gently) at one of their back legs. What causes me concern is that its always on whichever dog is being picked on. Since theres three pups, two can gang up on another, but this actually happens less frequently than one of the pups just bullying one of the others. Mom was raised with one of her littermates for about 2.5 years, and when she played with him she would always ""win"" by yanking the back leg out from under her brother, so we have seen this behavior from her before except she doesn't do it as extremely with the puppies.

The times where I have seen Mom join in have been both when they seem to be playing at what I deem an appropriate level of ""aggressive"" and when they've been ""too aggressive."" She will nibble on them and sometimes bite a back leg, but always on the pup thats being bullied.   


Should I be concerned? She has never hurt another dog in her life, but it concerns me that she's doing it on the pup who is being bullied. I'm trying to determine if the pups are being truly ""too aggressive"" and if so I plan to separate them when they are. They all have their own crates. Not sure when to have the pups stopped and not sure if mom is playing healthily or being a bully.

Regardless we can’t have him in the house and worry about if he’ll bite my wife or kids in the future. 

I’ve tried a lot of different options to manage having old dogs, little kids and a wife who doesn’t have the bandwidth for dogs, but the reality is the Doxie can’t be with the family any more. 

Fortunately I live 2 min from my parents house and they can take care of the Doxie but I’m torn on what to do with my Westie. She’s just a sweet lazy old dog who gets along with the kids and is just low maintnance in general. 

Do you think it’s better to keep both dogs together and have them live at my parents house or have my Doxie live with my parents and The Westie live with us. 

The tough thing for me is, I love both of the dogs a bunch and they both really prefer my company over anyone else in the family. I don’t want to call them therapy dogs but they both at times a have provided me with a lot of comfort and affection. It tears me up to  think about not have one or both of them in the house but I also don’t want to be selfish and separate the two when they’ve been together for over a decade.

This is very surprising cause he has never done this to anyone before, not even the guests he has never seen before.

Is there a way to get him more comfortable with them?

598,1668373459,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog just turned 2yo in September. She is a Pomeranian-pit bull mix with typically light skin (except for her speckled mouth) and a black and brown coat, like sable coloring on a Pom. Like the title says, I’ve noticed the skin on her “armpits” and down the inner part of all of her legs has started to turn dark gray. It’s more noticeable when I bathe her. There’s also a bit of it on her paws. The darker skin is still soft, has hair, and feels the same as the rest of her skin. She doesn’t itch the dark skin either. The only other issues she has are some itchiness from allergies, and she’s started shedding more lately. Both the shedding and discoloration seemed to begin when the weather started getting cold about a couple of weeks ago, if that has anything to do with it. 

I did do some Googling and the possibilities were overwhelming, so I wanted to check with you all to see if you’d experienced this with your pups before, or had some more specific insight than Google offered.

I tried to get a photo, but it doesn’t show up very well on camera for some reason and I didn’t think it would be helpful. I can try to get a photo again if it would help.

611,1668361205,self.DogAdvice,True,"You might have seen me spamming the sub about my little Golden and I appreciate all the advice I get here. 

I have a 2 year old Bichon who is *very* excitable and darts around when having fun. She isn't aggressive, more so timid until she is comfortable with you. 

She has been extremely tolerant of my 2 month old pup, which seems to be instinctual. So it isn't my Bichon I'm worried about bringing harm. 


Golden goes for the eyes, man. She is nothing by teeth and will nip every near her mouth. Anytime we tried to let them play, she just wants to bite Bichon. 

I *can* tell when either of them want to stop play or need space.. so it isn't that Golden is upset. This is just how she plays, as I assume puppies this age do. 

Bichon doesn't react with biting of tail or paws usually but she does get hurt and squeak, which is when I usually have to stop play. 


Also, I'm not sure if my Bichon knows how to correct the Golden? I don't know if that's really a thing dogs do at these ages.. I see her put her head over Golden and sometimes boop her with paw or snoot after being bitten. But other than that, I'm too scared of Golden taking an eye to let Bichon figure things out with her. 


Some online trainers say to just keep them separated until Golden is more matured. Other say that it's important to let them do this. 

But dude those teeth fucking her and Golden has just been really trying to get my Bichon's eyes.

615,1668350665,self.DogAdvice,True,"Our golden doodle Snoopy is 1y3m and has started more regularly leaving drops of poo after we pen him into the basement or behind a baby gate. 

A bit of backstory, we adopted him when he turned 1 in August, as his current parents were expecting at the time and couldn't sufficiently take care of him. He was completely matted, and suffered from anxiety being stuck at home in a mud room while both parents worked all day.

He has improved a lot and is doing well in our new dog training class! Still is very anxious about meeting new people but he is so full of love and joy with people he knows.

We tend to spend weekends at our parents house in the basement, which Snoopy loves as there are so many windows to see squirrels out of. Lately though, if we happen to need to leave him at home at our parents house (which he loves, it's a bit larger than our own), he will poop within 15 minutes of us penning him into the basement. I've tried going on walks for 15-30 minutes outside with him and he does seem to relieve himself completely right before we leave... He still has consistently left a pile right after we leave. 

I've heard some people say this might be ""revenge poo"" for leaving him alone and not taking him with us. He loves knowing where everyone is at and will routinely patrol the house and check all the windows when we're chilling at home. I can only think it has to do with anxiety, which I feel horrible about because especially for church there's nobody to stay home with him. Thankfully my wife works remotely and loves having him around, but for the times when we are both gone I can't imagine how hard it is for him.

Not really sure what to do at this point... Maybe we need to walk him for longer before leaving? Maybe he needs a smaller space to feel better?

621,1668316864,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello all! This is my first real post on Reddit so please bear with me. Idk if this is the right place to post but I need advice. I also want to say this event happed three years ago and I am just finding out about it now.

I have a dog who’s 10months. We aren’t sure what she is but we think shes a jack russle America bulldog mix. She’s very active and an amazing cuddle buddy. We love her but she is not the true reason I am posting. 

Today my partner and I were looking up  the trainer my parents recommend to us. We last minute needed a place to have her stay as we scored concert tickets. 

My parents swear by this guy and I have had a few training session with him and my dog and they were amazing. He clearly knows what he’s doing. His level of knowledge and experience is astounding. He’s trained both my parents German Shepard’s. My little 20lb dog seems like a cake walk for this trainer. 

Now here’s the problem: 

Today we searched his name in our city and right under his dog training website we saw a very concerning article. It detailed that a young teenager was mauled by four dogs that were this trainers dogs. He was paying this young man to feed and check on the dogs and was found mauled to death while the trainer was out of the country. It was clearly stated that our trainer gave up all his rights and was nothing but helpful in the investigation. The four dogs were euthanized. 

I don’t know how to feel. It’s a shock to know my dog is with him for the rest of the weekend and I’m not sure what to do. I thought I trusted him but this really makes me feel uncomfortable. I know he wasn’t even in the country when this happened and those dogs are no longer around but all I want to do is ditch my plans and go get my dog. 

Could someone give me advice? I really love this guy and have a tremendous amount of respect for him.

627,1668309309,self.DogAdvice,True,"I’ve had my dog, Echo, for about 2.5 years now. I got him when I was 21, the summer before my senior year of college. I am now in grad school and am starting a job full time in December. I love my dog with all of my heart - he has kept me alive through some really tough times in my life. However, my dog has some behavioral issues, and I am worried I am not giving him the life he deserves (I have three jobs and am in school full-time) and that I will not be able to do so when I start my new full-time job (I will be gone about 10 hours per day and he must be crated because he is destructive when I’m gone but he hates his crate no matter how much crate training I try to do with him - he even runs away from me every time I call him in the house because he is afraid I am going to put him away). Because of this I feel like I can’t leave my house for more than four hour at a time, but I have depression and anxiety and do the worst when I am home all day. Echo is reactive with new people, certain dogs, and with certain random triggers and has nipped people many times (he nipped my roommate the other day when they were moving a microwave, nips at me when I try to kill bugs, nips at people when they come up behind me). I moved to a house with a big yard so he and my roommate’s dog could run around and play and they do for hours a day but she is not home all the time and her schedule changes frequently. I have been to trainers and have talked to my vet about his reactivity but nothing seems to help. I am doing the absolute best I can with him and walk him on trails near my house but he has a crazy amount of energy (he is a shepherd beagle mix) and i feel like it is never enough as even after an hour walk he will bark at me to play with him. I am constantly anxious about him being near my roommates because I am afraid something new will trigger him and he will nip or even really bite one of them. My parents live in a big house on 35 acres and have another dog that he gets along with. My mom works from home and my dad is home and outside a lot so Echo could run around outside most of the time and there are not many people that come to their house and he does not have to be crated there because there is no roommates stuff around for him to tear up. I know they would give him a good life but I am not sure I can bear to part with him because I love him so much. What should I do?

630,1668305263,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi fellas. I'm the owner of a one year old cardigan corgi. In all aspects she is a perfectly normal dog, she's a healthy weight, she's energetic, playful, extremely curious, but as of late she has this really weird fixation on icecubes. 

She will beg relentlessly when I'm getting the icecube tray out of the freezer. She will sit next to me and put her paw on my foot over and over, like it's a treat I'm holding. If I ignore her, she'll jump up and even bark because she wants them so bad. If I give her one, she'll chew it until it's all gone. She'll even fetch for them or do tricks. It just has me really baffled because... Is it really that rewarding for her? I don't understand what in her head makes her want them so bad, it's just water after all. Tonight, she was upstairs with another member of the house, and I was making a drink with ice. I got the tray out, and as soon as I did that, she BOLTED downstairs, like straight up running. But if I were to let's say open the treat drawer, she probably wouldn't come running unless I shook the bag and shouted her name.

I also want to ask if this is okay to humor or if I should nip it in the bud? I don't know if they're good for her teeth or not. She is a very chewing dog, tears through chew toys really fast, chews through some household things. Not as bad as when she was a little puppy but she definetely enjoys it. I feel like she chews less after being given an icecube but I could totally be placeboing myself there. As of the moment she gets one icecube a day at the max.

643,1668287566,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have 3 dogs. 

2 year old basenji 
6 year old small hound mix
And 13year old elderly bully

The hound and bully have been living together for the last 5 years or so. The bully is dog selective but has gotten along very well with the hound and basenji. She is significantly bigger than the other 2 dogs. The basenji and hound are nearly the same size - slightly different but similar. 

Anyway, whenever the basenji and bully play or start getting riled up (play) the hound mix will immediately run up to the bully and growl on her and almost attack her - this has actually led to one fight between the bully and hound. The hound mix will ALSO bark aggressively (but not attacking) the basenji who then runs away doing zoomies. 

But basically the hound mix will ALWAYS intervene whenever my basenji and bully play! I do keep the hound mix away from the other 2 dogs because her behavior is not reliable or safe especially after that one fight. 

But I have no clue why she reacts that way. Her hair is raised and she immediately goes directly up to the bully and growls in her face (anyway the bully is deaf but it’s not like my other dogs know that).

Does anyone have any explanations on **why** this is happening? So far I’m working on subthreshold desensitizing training with the hound mix slowly and also removing her from the area if necessary as to not trigger her further. I just don’t know **why**?!

And PS. The basenji and hound play a LOT. The basenji and bully play as well.

655,1668265061,self.DogAdvice,True,"Im a first time dog owner, I have been struggling for a long time now to teach my pug not to pee in the house or other homes. I have tried to stay outside with him until he pees and give him a treat as a reward. I’ve taken him on lots of walks to get him used to peeing outside, but it still hasn’t worked after 4 years! I mean it’s not terrible, but sometimes when I leave him alone I end up finding pee in hidden places and I try to be really stern on him that it is not ok to do that. But all it’s done is made him better at hiding it instead of just telling when he needs to go. 
He also gets way worse if I take him to someone else’s home. For example, my younger sisters take him to the groomers for me since I usually don’t have time in the day for work to take him. So I leave him at my parents for a night. But every time I get angry calls from my my mom that he keeps peeing on her couches and beds, and it surprises me that although he does it here and there at my house, he is substantially worse when I’m not around.

658,1668263210,self.DogAdvice,True,"My wife and I got a 3 y/o male beagle from a rescue back in June and he hates me. He always has. He was super nervous the first few weeks we had him, but we assumed this was just because he was settling in. A month goes by and he fully settles in with my wife. When I'm at work, he plays with her, lays with her, follows her, and even learns how to sit. Every day I come home it's the same old story. He howls when he hears my car pull up, he barks when I come through the door, he poops and pees wherever he is standing when I walk into the living room, and then he runs and hides in his crate.

We then assumed he may have been abused by a man, after all, he was a hunting dog and given up because ""he wasn't good at hunting."" However, my wife and I went on vacation for a week and during this time, we left him with a petsitter. I warned the petsitter that he might have some really bad anxiety when her husband was home to the point that me might bark and defecate himself. To my relief, she said this was no problem. However, during our trip the sitter sent me several pictures and videos of our dog sitting in her husband's lap, kissing him, and playing with him. It was very sweet, but it also broke my heart.

I've given nothing but kindness to this dog. I give him treats, I make his meals, I take him on his walks, I lay by his crate and scratch his ears and chin. And yet, nothing seems to work. It's been five months now and this dog has made little to no progress with me. I am writing this right now while my wife bathes him because he just pooped all over himself after I tried to take him outside.

I would've given him away to someone I know personally who would take care of him had my wife not already grown so attached to him. I don't know what to do at this point.

676,1668225334,self.DogAdvice,True," I adopted an 2 month old golden retriever last weekend and she will be 3 months tomorrow. 

My first dog, who is now 2, was admittedly neglected in training and it took a while for us to potty train her. But it was ""easier"" when she was a puppy because I just ignored her and let her do what she wanted, while sleeping with us. 


I learned my lesson and want to do things right (while also training my 2 yr old). Which right now means not a single drop of pee on the carpet and she *will* be crate trained.

But for fuck sake I haven't slept more than maybe 3 hours a night since I got her. Some nights I just don't fucking sleep at all.

She is sleeping in bed with us, which I can already hear you all screaming. But it was advised by a YT trainer and her breeder to have her sleep with us at first to help ease her transition.

The thought is that she is still too young to really be trained or get what I'm trying to do and right now I need to focus on building her confidence and security. 

However, I think this is contributing to me losing sleep. Because it would be one thing if I just had to get up ever 2 or 3 hours for 10 minutes then go right back to bed. But she wakes up, bites me and fucks around, I bring her back to bed, then she bites and and fucks around for like fucking 15 minutes! Then I just can't sleep. 



I am crate training in the day time, she is at the point where she will voluntarily go into her crate for space sometimes. She will stay there when I put her in during a nap but she has to already be asleep. Today I tried putting her in as she was falling asleep and closing the door. She didn't like that, of course. 


So that's what I'm doing about crate training, in hopes that she will soon just sleep in there at night and that will solve the Potty Play Time issue. 

One thing that is giving me comfort is that she seems very smart and is extremely food motivated so training isn't that difficult... her recall is pretty perfect already, and I don't even need to use food anymore. 

So think the only obstacle with crate training or stuff that requires some separation from me is that she is just *so* attached to me. I can't leave the room without her losing her shit.

677,1668222639,self.DogAdvice,True,"I recently moved in with my boyfriend and we both have dogs. I have a big catahoula (f) and he has a little pomeranian (m). My dog has never really liked going into bathrooms once she learned that's where baths happen and she hates baths. But recently I've been catching her trying to get into the bathroom from time to time.

Why is this a problem? Because the bathroom is where my boyfriend's dog's stuff is. His bed, his toys, his water, and his food.

My dog gets fed 2 times a day and she eats all of her food within a few minutes. She loves food. Actually the only thing so far I know she *won't* eat is lettuce. My boyfriend's dog, however, has his bowl filled and we just fill it again once it's all gone. He seems to only want to eat when people are in the bathroom with him.

The food he had before started running out, and my boyfriend wasn't sure what food he's been eating (I think someone else bought the food for him) so we've started switching him to new food. It just so happens that the new food is the same brand as my dog's food. And I think my dog has been trying to get into the bathroom since we started giving his dog the new food. We're wondering if she smells something familiar and is trying to get to it because of that.

After getting home today from driving my boyfriend to work, I noticed his dog's food was entirely gone. Which would be impossible knowing how he eats and that I had refilled the bowl just maybe 2 hours or so earlier. The bowl was also in a weird spot, pushed up against the wall and his water bowl as if it had been nudged there, like when my dog eats and her bowl shifts. And my dog was acting super guilty when I got home, so I know she did it.

That's long winded, sorry. But basically I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to get my dog to leave his food alone. I don't want her over eating or eating food made for small breeds since she definitely is not one. The only thing I can think of right now is to set up a crate and put his food in the crate. Maybe the opening would be too small for her head and she wouldn't be able to get to it. Right now, I'm just having to keep the bathroom door closed unless we (my boyfriend or I) are going in, since that's the only time his dog seems to eat anyway. But I hate keeping him from his toys and water and such.

2. He doesn't allow anyone to examine his feet. We believe this is associated with arthritis, but even if not it seems understandable.

693,1668191598,self.DogAdvice,True,"Risks vs benefits. Spaying age/right time.

Small info blurb. Sweet girl is a German Shepherd, dalmation, great pyrenees mix. She's about 7.5 months old. The vet brought up getting her spayed and he wanted it done right away, like last month. I knew enough to know that larger breeds should wait. So, we started researching. I know that it's generally RECOMMENDED to wait until at least 2. However, we had decided to wait until after her first heat and go from there. We found that Mammory cancer was the big risk factor for waiting. Chances went up to like 8 percent waiting for first heat, increasing largely to 26 percent if we wait until after her second heat. So we HAD planned to get her spayed in the new year after her first heat after reading that large breeds typically go into heat their first time between 9-12 months. Well, 7 months and here's her first heat. Which if we were to get her spayed before her second heat, she would barely be a year old. And I'm iffy about that. 

So. Here's where I need help. IS Mammory cancer such a big risk that spaying based on heat cycles it worth it MORE than age? Or are the benefits of waiting until she's 2, out weight the risks of Mammory cancer? 

I know that it's so that the hormones can help her grow properly. That hip and bone problems become an issue when spayed earlier. But is that a reason to wait, when Mammory cancer is such a risk?

They also nip at eachother but theres been no serious injuries.

I always separate them though because my brothers dog is clearly bigger in size and is the one instigating by lunging and jumping on mine.

Usually my dog doesn’t play this way, but my brother has videos of his dog running and playing this way with other dogs so I wonder if its just mismatched playing styles?

699,1668183360,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 1 year old lab mix my mom has two 2 year old dogs one is a kelpie mix the other she says is a kelpie mix but it looks like a pit bull mix with something else idk it's a big dog. Her dogs are very very spoiled and mine is as well but is also well trained. 

Well we have recently moved in together due to financial reasons. I did not move into her house we collectively combined into a new house. 

How can I keep my dog separate and continue the training when her dogs are wild?? 

Examples - 

We have a backyard so she just leaves the back door open and lets the dogs have free range of the house and yard. I do not like this my dog had structured routine there are times to rest and there are times to play. My dog is getting all confused and thinks that play time is now all the time and is getting anxious and has also run so much that all four of her toe beans are raw and bleed at times. 

Her dogs constantly come in the kitchen and jump up on the counters and lick the food off of the dishes in the sink and lick the countertops. And lick off people's plates at the dinner table. My dog knows or at least knew to stay out of the kitchen she does not anymore and is now trying to jump up on the counters even though I continue to correct her. All of her training there is now gone because she's just following the other two dogs. 

Her dogs constantly bark and growl and fight, I know that sometimes when dogs play they look vicious but these dogs are actually growling like they're fighting I can tell the difference. She lets it go on for too long and aside from being dangerous to the dogs it's extremely loud and distracting and my dog gets mixed up in it often. 

It was agreed before we moved in together that all of the dogs would be sleeping in our respective bedrooms but that has not happened and I believe is now not going to happen because of the size of her dogs kennels. She says they take up too much space in her room so she's going to just leave them in the main living room. I want to keep my dog separate but she knows that the other two dogs are out there and she constantly whines and cries and I cannot lock her in the other room because the two dogs are in the living room and she can hear them. So if we're out in the kitchen and need the dogs locked away my dog is now in the back barking because she knows the other two dogs are still in the kitchen/living area.


Those are the biggest issues right now I guess, my biggest thing is how do I not ruin my dogs training while we are in this living situation and how do I handle my dogs jealousy at her dogs? 

And how do I keep my dog listening to me??? My dog is obviously gravitating towards the person with less rules and more treats for doing nothing. Also my dog will sit in my room and lick her paws until the fur comes off because she can hear the other dogs playing outside constantly.

701,1668178577,self.DogAdvice,True,"My SO (38M) and I (30F) have had dogs since we got together almost eleven years ago. SO is very attached to them and has a very hard time processing things such as sickness or pain when they are involved.

One of the pups (7F) has bone cancer, found out a couple days ago. He has been calling everywhere and got a date set to start the oncology work on the 15th. He’d like it sooner but that was after calling all oncology clinics in the state.

The thing is, it’s eating away at her leg bone and he can’t handle the stress of sitting around with that knowledge. After we get her in on the 15th we have to wait another week or so to set surgery and then another two weeks to start chemo. And he can’t function, knowing it could metastasize. There isn’t any way to get it fixed sooner. On top of all this, the vet says we will only have a few months to a year with her after all this. Not much chance of remission.

She’s on pain meds now but the leg is lame and it’s killing him to look at her. It kills me too but I’d rather focus on ways to alleviate her pain than crumbling in a similar way and not being able to help.

What can I say to him to help him be okay with the inevitable? Or is there any kind of process that can speed this up? I’m guessing no, there isn’t, but I have to keep trying.

She lets them all sleep in the house and every day when theres poop all over the house it is my responsibility to pick it up or if they eat the food off the counter I have to clean up the mess. We have goats as well and the dogs (mostly GS) have killed/injured multiple of our goats to which my mom will not seek veterinary care or make me help her throw away a dead goat. My moms queensland heelers and the german shepard all bite and growl and are very dog aggressive. I have been bit by my moms heeler at least 3 times unprovoked. 2 of the heelers are both VERY aggressive if you try to put them outside, if you come near them or try to grab their collar while the slider is open they WILL bite you and even if you are at a spot you think they cant reach theyll still reach their stubby little head down to bite you. My moms german shepard barks constantly and i was able to convince her to buy a bark collar but she also bites very severely and is dog aggressive towards the pitbull mostly but all of the other dogs. If me and my boyfriend buy any toys for the dogs or anything the german shepard will not let the dogs play with them she will circle and bark at them until they react and she has a reason to bite/attack them. The pitbull and the GS get into it pretty often(the pitbull isnt fixed and the GS is dog aggressive) and usually they scuffle and it sorts itself out then theyll be fine but there has been afew occasions that they get really messed up. This started pretty severely when i was 16 and it was most of the time just me home after school when the GS and pit would start trying to kill each other. Multiple times i have had to have my friends/family come attempt to break up the dog fights. but anyways this leads us to now they are in one of their hating eachother fits but the GS really really messed up the pit and one of the heelers joined in and chewed the back of her legs practically raw. My mom will not seek veterinary care. I have tried to get my mom to train them, ive offered to split the cost of crates for all of them, and i dont know what much else i can do. I know she will not get rid of them, i think the GS is the main source of the aggression and if we took her to the pound or gave her away that alone will make the situation much better. at this point i feel like it's either get rid of the GS or the pit is going to get killed and she is very sweet. only aggressive when aggression is shown to her but i think thats just because shes unfixed(we are getting her fixed next month i managed to convince my mom) but i just dont know what to do. I know she wont get rid of any of the dogs and she wont spend any money on them but i am trying to buy a new car and move out of my moms house and those arent even my dogs to begin with. My chihuahua has toys and is well taken care of because i have the time and resources for her but i can only afford the expenses of one dog and I dont want my moms dogs to die.",1,my mom wont stop

718,1668130273,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a one year old lab who is extremely high energy. She’s taken on at least an hour of walks a day with plenty of time to sniff. I was pretty good about training her for a while but I went away for two months so my parents watched her. 

I came back and noticed she had developed some behavior problems. The main issue is she jumps on people. Not everyone but just people she hasn’t seen in a while.

I’ve been having some problems with my roommate aggressively shoving and scolding my dog. My dog never pays any attention to my roommate besides an occasional sniff. Today he walked in and went to his room and my dog was following him when he shoved her face away. She wasn’t even touching him. Later today she was just sniffing him and he once again aggressively shoved her then yelled “no”. I confronted him and told him he doesn’t need to yell at her because she wasn’t doing anything. He said “well you don’t do anything about it”. 

I’ve been working on training her the last few days and I’m not going to pretend she’s a perfect dog at all but I just don’t know what to say to my roommate to get him to stop scolding and shoving my dog cause obviously I’m not cool with that.

727,1668115815,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog is a sharpei/chow mix who is estimated to be about 10 or 11 years old right now. We adopted our boy in 2016 when he was about 5. 2016 to 2020 were great years. 2020 he got attacked by a loose dog. 2020 he also had his first vestibular episode (unrelated to the attack). 2021 another vestibular episode which took away his ability to jump on and off our bed. 2022 he had another episode and his balance is pretty wonky now. He developed bad anxiety (panting and pacing). After lots of vet visits and test treatments with anxiety medicine, it was determined that he likely has a brain lesion or tumor to explain his odd behavior and his hair trigger anxiety. :(

The medicine he is on now seems to help him act more “normal” but I’ve accepted that he’ll never be the 2016-2020 version of himself. Trazadone helps keep his anxiety at bay. He still has panting episodes though if there is any change in routine. Melatonin at night to help him sleep and an nsaid to help his arthritis because his back legs are stiff. 

Honestly, this last year it has been so stressful to own a dog. I would never ever re-home him and I’m definitely not wishing for anything to happen to him. I just feel trapped and my mental health has seriously plummeted. I want to cherish the years we have left but sometimes it’s hard when he gives me anxiety! 

Any slight change in routine and he gets super anxious. I’m not kidding, my husband and I literally have to “assume position” at the end of the night on the couch with him. If we don’t, he will pace and pant. For example, last weekend I laid down for a nap at 6:30 pm in my bed which was not normal for him. He paced the entire time I was trying to lay down in the bedroom because I wasn’t in the living room like “normal” when the evening came. 

My husband has to sleep on the couch with him at night and then sneak off to bed with me after he falls asleep. We have to plan out when to give him Trazadone if we decide to go out in the evening. If we stay home, it’s always 7:30 pm but we can’t always be home at that time. Our sex life revolves around if he is asleep or outside.

To top it off, all of these issues started at the beginning of this year which is also when I found out I’m pregnant. I’m currently weeks away from birth and he has ruined my mental health and made my pregnancy so stressful. I have to tip toe around his anxiety otherwise he pants and paces. He is in for a rude awakening when the baby is here because I can’t promise his routine will stay the same each and everyday. 

We tried Xanax and it gave him a HORRIBLE reaction that landed him in the ER. We tried natural remedies and that does nothing. 

My husband is less inclined to think it’s his time. He’s willing to wait til he’s on his last leg but the amount of times this dog has made me cry or given me a panic attack in the last year is insane. He will never be his old self again. Bringing our baby home soon is stressing me out all because of him. 

I know this may sound like there is no quality to his life but there is. He uses the bathroom no problem. He eats and drinks. He still loves going outside and going on walks, even though we can’t walk as long now. Our vet told us it will be time when he stops doing what he loves. 

I guess I’m just looking for similar stories and advice on how to cope with a stressful senior pet. It’s so challenging to feel trapped and feel guilty for feeling trapped. I’ve debated many times if euthanasia is the best option but it feels like murder since physically he is fine and when he’s happy, it’s great.

731,1668106924,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I’m in training on a SAR team with my K9 Briggs. On the team, the majority of people have their ID as the dog jumping on the person. Briggs is usually very cautious when approaching strangers, so when he finds someone, he usually stops short of them and stares at them. This is actually an improvement, because he used to softly growl at them (it was an unsure of them thing, not an intimidation thing). So to get him to stop growling at them, I would praise him for finding them (based on his behavior change), so now I need a definite ID from him, but I don’t know what to make him do. 
When there’s no scent for him to follow, he jumps on me. When he’s alerting on a door, he’ll sit at the door. 
I thought of having his ID be to sit and give me a ‘speak’, but it’s not ‘natural’ for him, and he doesn’t know that command yet. Additionally, I’m afraid if I’m finding an autistic child, then Briggs will scare the child with his bark.

734,1668102853,self.DogAdvice,True,"We adopted a bijon frisee ten years ago. We realized that he had a perpetual problem when he treated collars like shock collars. He was silent when we first got him but he had been returned multiple times so we figured there was a serious problem. Keep in mind that we are both physically handicapped and can't move quickly to correct him. Here's what we've done so far, all with supporting advice from trainers and vets:

-	Verbal correction
-	Thunder shirts
-	Water pistol
-	Keeping on lead by our sides for physical correction
-	Two different trainers, one in their own home. 
-	Daily exercise and/or dog park with our other dogs
-	Time out in kennel
-	Rewarding for silence
-	Ear hoodies
-	Vibration collar (responds pretty well to this but becomes inured to low pulse and we think it's cruel).
-	Clicker training for silence

He barks full voice. He barks at any sound inside or out of the house. I just picked up my coffee cup and he barked at the sound of my nails on the porcelain cup. If I sneeze, he barks, fart and he barks, stirring a pot of soup, talking to my spouse, dogs miles away, everything and all the time. 

I'm a diagnosed trauma tension ""sufferer"" who refuses anxiety meds because it's stupid that this dog's sharp bark results in anxiety. He just never stops. The neighbors are complaining, dog owners are complaining when he barks at their dogs' normal alerts, he barks the whole time we are gone from the house.

He's got to be miserable. His back is just tight muscles and no amount of anxiety supplements or herbs help. He's developed a heart murmur and he'll probably die of it, it's so serious. 

Horrible admission: I talked to spouse about letting him go when he starts seizures or passing out. I have developed a diagnosed heart problem myself because every time he barks unexpectedly I jump (has to do with the reason I have PTSD). But I just can't kill an anxious but healthy dog. 

We're all missing something. Diazepam works 20 minutes for him and I refuse the meds for me.

I have given her hydrolyzed food and it is not stopped her itching. She does not have fleas. One key point I want to add is that about a year ago she was attacked on a hike by two large dogs.

746,1668052609,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi guys! I have a very smart Aussie/blue heeler mix pup (female; born Aug 2), but I’m struggling a bit with helping her learn how to interact with dogs.

My neighbor has a very old chihuahua (he’s very chill) but my puppy gets far too excited with him. I would really like to facilitate better boundaries so that they could interact more. 

We share a fenced yard. I’ve tried holding her u til she calms down, letting them sniff while both are being held by separate people, and putting her in a leash. I’ve been unsuccessful in getting her to remain calm around him. Even if I can get her seemingly calm laying next to me, she immediately loses it when he comes close.
He’s simply too old for her to be so aggressively playful, but we share a yard and besides, it is not a behavior I want to continue. 

Note: I only use positive reinforcement; but she does understand the following commands: sit, down, wait, stand, spin, and no. She also has pretty good leash manners (better every day).

750,1668044894,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog has black nails so I opted for an electric grinder over clippers. It used to be a breeze. He used to sit still the entire time when I first adopted him but with time it’s become a nightmare. First, he incessantly licks at the grinder when I’m doing his nails and one time he got too close. It was okay it just startled him a bit. When I have friends over or my partner they give him little treats while I do his nails and that usually works. Tonight I am by myself and needed to do his nails. I’ve done it alone many times but I wanted it to be a pleasant experience  for him tonight so I offered him a little raw hide chew to work on while I did his nails so that he wouldn’t lick at the grinder. He ignored the chew and thrust the entire time to get away. I feel like the chew made things worse cause he was focused on having it but wanted it in the right setting (to be comfortable chewing on it) I finished his nails using his training treats to distract him instead and gave him the chew immediately after.

751,1668044382,self.DogAdvice,True,"Cross-posted to r/vet but looking for some level-headed advice from other dog parents. 

7 year old lab mix with propensity to eat things she should not (but always passes them)

55lbs, spayed. Takes 16mg apoquel daily. 

On Sunday, she was in her kennel and must have gnawed off part of her fleece blanket. We noticed this in her stool the next day. While she hasn't eaten this before, she's taken a stab at a kennel cover, a back pack, a passport, and various other inedibles over the years without issue. 

She's eating, drinking, and behaving normally. We don't see any fleece after Monday night. Stomach is soft, she doesn't seem to have any pain.

This morning, I wake up to find her pooping in our bed. Normal stool (not diarrhea) but unusual. I think it might be an anxiety poop since her schedule is off and we have been packing for a cross country move. She has pooped inside because of anxiety before. 

I take her to a 24 hour vet out of an abundance of caution, and because I'm nervous about any issues during move. 

they take x-rays, but overall she looks fine according to the vet. Says her belly is soft. We get sent home with antibiotics and a probiotic for any digestive upset. 

This evening, they call and say they sent the x-rays to a radiologist who identified something in her stomach that ""likely"" is the blanket. They recommend surgery or at least observation in their ICU, fasting, and rescan tomorrow. I ask if we can just fast her overnight and bring her back, vet doesn't like that plan. I ask if we can get her scans from this morning and talk to our normal vet tomorrow for a second opinion. She says she doesn't know if they can send the scans and the radiologist was a second opinion. Idk if she was frustrated but she seemed to really dislike that I asked.

I'm at a loss here, I have whiplash from the ""yeah she's fine"" to ""no she needs surgery."" Am I making a massive mistake by waiting to see her normal vet tomorrow? She has separation anxiety and I feel like an overnight is also overkill when she is behaving like her happy, normal self.

The complicating factor  were supposed to leave for our move on Friday. It's a three day trip, and we will be pretty far from emergency care Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon when we arrive. I will push it back and pay for a hotel to stay with her if she needs surgery but I feel like I'm not getting a good picture of the situation when there was this massive switch.

She's pooped, ate, drank, and played all day.

753,1668041331,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I've asked before on here pretty sure and I've emailed our local humane society for advice from their behaviorist, but I'm not having any luck. 


My sister has a small chiweenie  that was a rescue from a hoarder situation, she's 9 years old now, we've had her little over a year.  She was clearly abused given by all the scars on her face, she used to bark and run away from everything but now its escalated to barking and charging at stuff to bite it- atleast for me and my dogs. 

A few months ago when I first asked for advice it happened after she bit me for the first time. Had to get stitches but I blame myself because I could've handled the situation better. Long story short sister left the house, dog somehow got foot stuck in spiral notebook, tried to help dog and she was letting me until I got pliers then- chomped.  She was scared amd hurt so really dont blame her.

After that I tried really  hard to get her to like me like she's super food motivated so I give her treats and bought her lickimatts and treat toys to help her destress.  For awhile it did seem like she was really coming around to me, like she would come up to me at the gate wagging her tail expecting a treat and isn't as upset when my sister isn't home. 

But she's suddenly made a U-turn to being mean again. My sister let her out of her room and she charged at me barking tried to grab my leg but thankfully just grabbed my pants legs. She's tried that a couple times now and my sister ignores me and tells me it's no big deal.

Now when I come over to the doggy gate at my sisters door she runs up to the gate barking, snarling, and trying to get at me through the gate. Literally yesterday I put a basket of clothing  by the gate and she grabbed a sweater sleeve through the gate and started biting the hell out of it. 

I don't know what to do honestly,  I've done what I can safely and my sister doesn't seem to care or see a big deal about the behavior. I've told her that she needs to start walking the dog or burn off some of that energy to help with stress and don't use negative reinforcement bc she's already afraid(ie spray bottle and yelling) at bare minimum. Neither suggestions have been used.

771,1668026000,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I adore my dog. He's an ""American"" Corgi. I knew he was a corgi mix when I got him. But I didn't really know about the fashion breed until after. I have a full Pembroke. Anyway, I got him when he was about nine months old. So he wasn't a puppy. The story is that he was the last of a litter. No one wanted him because he wasn't real heavy with the red merle that they wanted. And he didn't get the blue eyes. So he was kind of cast aside. The breeder ended up moving and couldn't sell him so her mom took him. And she breeds American Bulldogs. My little guy was kept mostly in a kennel that was heated and cooled, according to the seller. She said he got plenty of time hanging out with the other dogs. But I have no clue what happened as far as training goes. She said he was in the process of potty training.

I've had him now for three years. I finished his training. So he does awesome on leashes. He's potty trained. Does really well with other dogs. And cats. Like amazing with cats. Good dog. Super smart. Learned really fast. BUT during the first year I noticed some odd behavior. One, he was scared of males at first. To the point when my boyfriend would pet him, he'd pee. Second, showing any kind of discipline would also make him pee. He'd flinch if he thought he was in trouble. He'd pee if we raised our voice. So of course I'm assuming he was abused.

A lot of the behavior we've corrected with patience and consistency. He started getting food aggressive but we've corrected that. He's still really bad about getting into the trash. But here's the thing... so let me first say he trained *himself* to go into the kennel. Like... he realized when we leave, we put him in the kennel. So when we put our shoes on, that's where he goes. I'm again assuming this is a save haven for him. So any time he thinks he's in trouble, he also puts himself in the kennel. It got to the point where now we don't really know how to punish him. Because now he growls at us when he gets in trouble. 

His body language is more like he's scared. We've NEVER hit him. We do not believe in physically correcting our dogs. Just... no. But he definitely backs himself into the kennel and growls when we get onto him. He's bitten me once. He got a pork chop the cat had knocked down. And I reached for it thinking I could grab it. Big mistake on my part. I didn't say anything, I just moved really fast and he snapped at me. I should have known because at that point I was aware of how scared he gets. Because usually, I'll tell him drop it and I can grab what he's got. 

He's not protective of the kennel. I can reach in there just fine. I can reach in there when he's in there. I try not to reach around him when he's eating. I feel like he gets really uptight when he eats. I can move the bowl slowly, though. So I don't know if the food aggression is linked to the kennel thing. I don't know if the abuse is just that deeply rooted. My boyfriend and I have been playing around with different ideas. Like putting a blanket of the kennel when he's in trouble? Or leaving the kennel shut until we need to let him in there. I don't know. 

What I do know is that if something works, he'll pick it up. He's seriously the smartest thing. I just don't understand why he still gets scared and why he flinches. He's been with us for three years, now, and we've never hit him. I don't know why he's so scared. I'm really looking for ways to kind of correct this behavior so he can know better when he's in trouble.

776,1668008353,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 9 year old mutt, Blu (medium sized, \~30lbs, I was told he is part basset, part blue heeler) that I got when I was a teenager and still living with my mom.  When I moved out of my mom's house, I didn't take him with me because my mom's house had a large yard and I was moving into an apartment, so I didn't think it would be fair to him.  Almost 2 years ago, my mom's house burned down, and my husband and I had recently gotten an apartment with a yard so I took him in.  When my mom's house was rebuilt, the fenced off yard was significantly smaller.  My mom already has 2 dogs, and she is not the best dog owner.  She doesn't train them or even correct their bad behavior, and she rarely lets them out of her room.  2 months ago, I had to ask my mom to watch Blu for a couple weeks while we were living with a friend and waiting to move in to a house.  The yard at our house is large and would be perfect for Blu, but there are neighborhood deer that frequently come around, and Blu has a past of chasing wildlife (chickens, guineas, and peacocks that are no longer around at my mom's).  The yard is fenced in, but I wouldn't put it past him to jump right over it if he wanted to.  I haven't brought him to our house yet, because I'm worried he'll chase the deer, but leaving him with my mom with so little space makes me feel immense guilt.  He is getting older, and I want him to spend his last years with as much room to play as we can give him, but I'm so worried about what would happen if he attacked a deer.  This has caused a few small arguments between my husband and I because he thinks its a bad idea to bring Blu around the deer, and while I agree it could be a problem, I feel like I'm abandoning my dog.  

Any advice on what to do in this situation would be appreciated.

787,1667974542,self.DogAdvice,True,"I live with my Nan and we don't have the greatest relationship but we try and make things work.

Nan has wanted a dog for a long time (there is already a Shepherd in the house), and I have seen this as a good idea as long as it was a good size and age. For a long time there were disagreements about the dog, as I've been unsure how the Shepherd will go with another dog. As well as the fact Nan wanted large dogs which would be hard for her to walk. 

So anyway, Nan has impulsively bought an 8 week old poodle cross dog. A toy breed. (At least it's small!)

Nan barely gets out of bed, clearly suffers from depression (has treatment for this), she seems to be having frequent falls and hides this from family - Her idea is leaving the puppy in the crate for long periods of time, as well as cuddles and feeds. 

But I am stuck looking after puppy majority of the time, Nan is upset and angry that I am interfering yet she isn't meeting the puppies needs. The pup is very energetic and Nan is hardly up for most of the day. Hardly asks to see or spend time with pup. If I want her to see or look after puppy because I'm going somewhere, she just tells me ""put him in the crate"".

Hi guys, I bought my 9 month old Bordoodle to the beach on Saturday, and it’s now Wednesday. I’m assuming he would have ingested some water and sand because he loved playing a game where I kick the water and sand, and he jumps up and tries to bite it. He’s had diahrea starting the day after we got home on Sunday, and still has it today (Wednesday) it’s a green ish kind of colour too. I called the vets yesterday and they said to try him on rice and boiled chicken and if it doesn’t go in 2 days to call them. They also said to give him so pro kolin and he’s only had one dose yesterday since there was only a bit left, but are picking more up for him this afternoon. 

Other than the diahrea, he has been acting his normal energetic and hungry self. 

I’m just worried because is beach diahrea supposed to last this long? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I can’t take my mind off if.

795,1667963991,self.DogAdvice,True,"My ex and I adopted a pup (Springer Spaniel) who is now two. When we split we decided that because our dog always seemed to love me more I’d keep him. 

My ex moved out a few weeks ago but has been in &amp; out on weekends to spend time with the dog. Pup is very happy to see him and sad each time he leaves. 

He went to daycare today and seemed fine as we drove to/from. Right as we were nearly home I had to stop suddenly and he slid forward in his seat slightly (he does have a seatbelt restraint and it was on - he didn’t slide enough to have got hurt at all, just an inch or two with plenty of slack left) and he immediately tried to climb in my lap for reassurance/attention. I didn’t let him and pushed him off. 

He ate as normal at home, and immediately went to sleep as he always does on daycare days. But now he’s up and about and not listening to me - growling if I get too close to him (I’m not pushing it as he’s being clear he doesn’t want me in his space) and when I tried calling him he looked at me then went to his kennel but after a few minutes he came out and is sleeping next to me on the couch (close but not touching)

Am I rounding up a bad mood or could this be changes because of his “dad” coming &amp; going and him feeling uncertain and off kilter from it? How can you tell the difference?

796,1667958817,self.DogAdvice,True,"We adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues

I'm deciding to post here because I can't find a lot of information online for our particular situation.

My boyfriend and I just bought our first house and he brought his 10 year old American Eskimo dog Jack. I've always wanted a dog and I advocate for adoption from shelters. I've always said I'd get the oldest dog at the pound. Well at the shelter, the longest resident(s) were two, a bonded pair. So that's what we got, now we have 3 dogs. The pair are almost 4 years old, siblings, shepherd/boxer mixed with some other breeds. Brother and sister, named them Dipper and Mabel.

Mabel is very shy and timid, and the shelter workers called Dipper her protector. Dipper is much more outgoing.

Well, Mabel has clamped onto Jack's head 3 times within the past month that we've all lived here. The first time, I was giving Jack a treat in front of the pair and I think she got jealous idk. This was the bite that lasted the longest (7 seconds or so). 

Please note she always bites his head and never breaks skin.

The second bite was when there was a visiting dog in the neighbors yard and our 3 dogs got excited. Maybe Dipper and Mabel, or just Mabel was scared. Jack was barking at the neighbor dog and then Mabel clamped onto his head and shook him. 

The third time was just now, when we were all in the bedroom, on the bed except for Jack. All of us were playing together and having fun, but Jack was just on the floor watching. After we (thought) we all calmed down, my boyfriend went to bring Jack up onto the bed with us (he isn't usually on the bed because it's too high a jump) Mabel went to bite him again, we think she missed because we reacted so quickly. But Jack still yelped for being scared, maybe she got his fur, or maybe she did bite him. Either way, this bite lasted the least amount of time.

After doing some research I think they have littermate syndrome and Mabel got the short end of the stick. 

Looking for training advice or behavioral insights, obviously it's too late to prevent littermate syndrome. 

They are bonded and stop eating when they are separated, so getting rid of one of them is out of the question.

Also worth noting, after my boyfriend got Mabel off Jack the first time, I went to pick up Jack and then Dipper bit me on the back and tugged on me, not breaking skin but still left a big bruise. This was within the first week of adoption and honestly not worried about Dipper's aggression as it was only one instance provoked by Mabel getting yelled at and pried off, and he just wanted to do something to help her. If someone thinks this is something to worry about, please let me know but I'm more focused on Mabel's aggression.

We think the 2nd two instances were her trying to play with Jack but really not sure. Jack does not want to play.",1,"we adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues",text,531,"['adopted', 'bonded', 'pair', 'one', 'behavior', 'issue', 'adopted', 'bonded', 'pair', 'one', 'behavior', 'issuesim', 'deciding', 'post', 'cant', 'find', 'lot', 'information', 'online', 'particular', 'situationmy', 'boyfriend', 'bought', 'first', 'house', 'brought', '10', 'year', 'old', 'american', 'eskimo', 'dog', 'jack', 'ive', 'always', 'wanted', 'dog', 'advocate', 'adoption', 'shelter', 'ive', 'always', 'said', 'id', 'get', 'oldest', 'dog', 'pound', 'well', 'shelter', 'longest', 'resident', 'two', 'bonded', 'pair', 'thats', 'got', '3', 'dog', 'pair', 'almost', '4', 'year', 'old', 'sibling', 'shepherdboxer', 'mixed', 'breed', 'brother', 'sister', 'named', 'dipper', 'mabelmabel', 'shy', 'timid', 'shelter', 'worker', 'called', 'dipper', 'protector', 'dipper', 'much', 'outgoingwell', 'mabel', 'clamped', 'onto', 'jack', 'head', '3', 'time', 'within', 'past', 'month', 'weve', 'lived', 'first', 'time', 'giving', 'jack', 'treat', 'front', 'pair', 'think', 'got', 'jealous', 'idk', 'bite', 'lasted', 'longest', '7', 'second', 'please', 'note', 'always', 'bite', 'head', 'never', 'break', 'skinthe', 'second', 'bite', 'visiting', 'dog', 'neighbor', 'yard', '3', 'dog', 'got', 'excited', 'maybe', 'dipper', 'mabel', 'mabel', 'scared', 'jack', 'barking', 'neighbor', 'dog', 'mabel', 'clamped', 'onto', 'head', 'shook', 'third', 'time', 'bedroom', 'bed', 'except', 'jack', 'u', 'playing', 'together', 'fun', 'jack', 'floor', 'watching', 'thought', 'calmed', 'boyfriend', 'went', 'bring', 'jack', 'onto', 'bed', 'u', 'isnt', 'usually', 'bed', 'high', 'jump', 'mabel', 'went', 'bite', 'think', 'missed', 'reacted', 'quickly', 'jack', 'still', 'yelped', 'scared', 'maybe', 'got', 'fur', 'maybe', 'bite', 'either', 'way', 'bite', 'lasted', 'least', 'amount', 'timeafter', 'research', 'think', 'littermate', 'syndrome', 'mabel', 'got', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'looking', 'training', 'advice', 'behavioral', 'insight', 'obviously', 'late', 'prevent', 'littermate', 'syndrome', 'bonded', 'stop', 'eating', 'separated', 'getting', 'rid', 'one', 'questionalso', 'worth', 'noting', 'boyfriend', 'got', 'mabel', 'jack', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'pick', 'jack', 'dipper', 'bit', 'back', 'tugged', 'breaking', 'skin', 'still', 'left', 'big', 'bruise', 'within', 'first', 'week', 'adoption', 'honestly', 'worried', 'dipper', 'aggression', 'one', 'instance', 'provoked', 'mabel', 'getting', 'yelled', 'pried', 'wanted', 'something', 'help', 'someone', 'think', 'something', 'worry', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'im', 'focused', 'mabels', 'aggressionwe', 'think', '2nd', 'two', 'instance', 'trying', 'play', 'jack', 'really', 'sure', 'jack', 'want', 'play']",adopted bonded pair one behavior issue adopted bonded pair one behavior issuesim deciding post cant find lot information online particular situationmy boyfriend bought first house brought  year old american eskimo jack ive always wanted advocate adoption shelter ive always said id get oldest pound well shelter longest resident two bonded pair thats got  pair almost  year old sibling shepherdboxer mixed breed brother sister named dipper mabelmabel shy timid shelter worker called dipper protector dipper much outgoingwell mabel clamped onto jack head  time within past month weve lived first time giving jack treat front pair think got jealous idk bite lasted longest  second please note always bite head never break skinthe second bite visiting neighbor yard  got excited maybe dipper mabel mabel scared jack barking neighbor mabel clamped onto head shook third time bedroom bed except jack u playing together fun jack floor watching thought calmed boyfriend went bring jack onto bed u isnt usually bed high jump mabel went bite think missed reacted quickly jack still yelped scared maybe got fur maybe bite either way bite lasted least amount timeafter research think littermate syndrome mabel got short end stick looking training behavioral insight obviously late prevent littermate syndrome bonded stop eating separated getting rid one questionalso worth noting boyfriend got mabel jack first time went pick jack dipper bit back tugged breaking skin still left big bruise within first week adoption honestly worried dipper aggression one instance provoked mabel getting yelled pried wanted something help someone think something worry please let know im focused mabels aggressionwe think nd two instance trying play jack really sure jack want play

806,1667951610,self.DogAdvice,True,"I’ve been working at a all in one pet facility for sometime now and have noticed a lot of erratic and stressed out dogs that come here and that’s no fault to our own it’s just how it is based on our specific focus noted on our site and founding history. I just don’t think people know that there are so many other variations of boarding that could cater to your dogs specific needs. My specific facility focuses more on hygiene and cleanliness as opposed to interacting and getting to know some of these dogs, which means that the dogs are supervised but we rarely touch or interact with them. Let alone do they get to socialize with each other. This doesn’t sound like a big deal to most but certain dogs need that stimulation and interaction. Our dogs just stay in cells all day separated from each other . And for puppies, Honestly if you have the money for it I’d highly suggest doing board and trains as opposed to just boarding a dog anywhere. I used to think my dog would be loved on and cared for by any reputable hosting company but that’s not true. I’ve also visited some other facilities and noticed that these animals are also just put into isolated cells for long periods of time .

808,1667950838,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit so if I mess up the protocol it's just ignorance, sorry.

We have an approximately 2 year old mixed breed rescue dog. I suspect she has Pitbull, whippet and possibly Blue Heeler in her make up. Could be from a litter of hunting dogs.

She is a real handful and we have had a hard time getting her into a good place but the effort is paying off. Her obedience swings between Crufts level amazing and f... you depending on her focus. She exhibits possessiveness, dominance, stubborness, high prey drive / movement fixation and jealousy but not to an aggressive degree, we are slowly making headway stopping her jumping up on people and getting rid of a few irritating behaviors. 

I've had a few dogs and have a reasonable understanding of training and dog behavior but this wee bugger is the hardest dog I have ever had to train. Very smart, very stubborn.

This post is a cry for help to stop her trying to bite our feet when we walk and also to find out why she will growl and guard our feet if we or someone else touches them. She will display this behavior if we ask a stranger to touch their own feet... It's got me flummoxed.

I can only think that she may be possessive of them because they are at ground level, it's really weird behavior.

The days of tickling my girlfriends feet when she is on the couch are fading, the mutt will growl mildly and block any effort to touch them. I can stop her growling but she will not move away.

810,1667946208,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello!

My partner and I are adopting a dog through a rescue program that rehomes stray dogs. So far, all things considered, he has been very well behaved - gentle spirit, no accidents in the house, learning basic commands quickly, fine with crates, and good around cats, children, and other dogs. 

We understand that as he adapts to his new environment, these things may change, but the one behavior we want to especially address is his obsession with food. Naturally, being a former stray, he’s not used to receiving meals regularly. His excitement over food has grown, to the point where he is beginning to jump onto furniture in the hopes of reaching more food, especially the cat’s.

When eating, he is ok with people petting him and moving his bowl, and growls a little when bones are taken away. No biting or aggressive behavior, but we also want to make sure he doesn’t develop that either in his obsession.

Some suggestions from trainers we have been given include investing in pet-safety cupboard locks and rewarding him with food/treats when his energy has simmered down and he’s no longer hyper focused on getting food. Curious what people’s success stories are and what other tips you may have?

811,1667945503,self.DogAdvice,True,"When I adopted my golden retriever, she was a few days shy of 8 weeks old. I got her from a breeder that breeds for hunting and they seemed to check all the ""ethical breeder"" boxes. 


However, the last time I adopted a puppy- it was from a backyard breeder (before I knew better) and she had no medical records, I didn't know how old she was supposed to be and we just fed her what the bag told us to before ultimately free feeding. 




So, I don't really know exactly what's right here. The hunting breeder instructed us to feed the pup only *twice* a day and .25 to .5 cup of dog food each time. She said we could use the kibble for training treats as well. I thought this was odd, since she's a bigger breed and I figured puppies eat more frequently.. she explained that they don't want their dogs ""growing too fast"" because of their growth plates which made sense to someone who knows very little about this stuff. 


Here's my concerns:

1. She is much smaller than I expected. I googled what they were suppose to look like and she seems younger. Her records say ""5lbs"" and I know her mother is a bit on the smaller side. 5lbs is supposedly the minimum weight for this age... but her face looks so much younger..like still that squished up newborn look? 


2. She is *so* hungry. I will feed her 1/3 cup at 8AM, maybe a little less for training treats, then 1/3 at 5PM.  Today, it sounded like her tummy was grumbling and she puked in her mouth a little.  Which sounds like hungry pukes (my bichon got like this when she refused to eat certain foods). 


I know some dogs are just highly good motivated and always ""hungry"", that they'll engorge themselves until they're sick. I also read that a sign of over feeding is diarrhea, which she had a couple of times when I gave her a little more food but I just brought her home on Friday so I can tell if it's just stress shits..

The first night she slept well, shit well, ate well. She just seemed to feel at home and is already pretty comfortable. 


Should I be feeding her at this frequency? I'm feeding her the same dog food the breeder used.

Linked is some pics of her so maybe you can tell me if she seems big enough to be 2 months old..Google can be deceitful sometimes. 

Excuse my nasty car.

My beautiful 8 month old Samoyed Nimbus is scratching at my walls and I'm at a loss of what to do. 

Info- 
- it's not one dedicated spot it's multiple
- he gets multiple walks a day as we are in an apartment so lots of trips outside to do his business as well as 1 to 2 30minute walks. 
-he has plenty of toys and bones to chew on. 
-He has access to me all day as I work from home and he doesn't scratch at all if he's home alone. 
- he has one napped for 5 minutes then proceeded to stand up and scratch the wall then go back to sleep.
-I have contacted his breeder and even she is at a loss. 


I have days where he is an absolute angel and sleeps while I work from home and we play etc on my breaks, then there's days that from the get go he is scratching at the walls.

into a house two months ago.
I had wanted a dog for a long
time and even have
experience with other
herding dog breeds. We were
desperate. So we got a dog
from the shelter. They're one
of those horrible shelters that don't even allow you to meet
the dog unless you're going
to adopt it, and trap you into
taking a dog home without
making an informed decision.
Zeus is an Australian cattle
dog. Like I said, I've had
herding dogs before so l
thought I could handle it. But
I've never had a cattle dog.
Some stuff came up and now
my husband and I have to
work so much that no one
would be here with Zeus throughout the day. He has a
big yard to run in but all we
can offer him with our
schedules and sanity is a
brief walk at the end of the
day. He is horribly behaved
and is incapable of being
anywhere but inside his
kennel or outside. Otherwise
it is chaos. He is destructive
and hurts people- you can't
even sit on the couch without
him getting on top of you and
biting/nipping your face. He does not respond to no. He does not let go when he
grabs things. He barks. He
has harmed our child nephew and tried to bite our
baby nephew. He can be
aggressive. He is a lost.
Freaking. Cause. We've tried
everything and at this point
with our schedules there is
no way on the planet we will
be able to keep trying. I do
think he loves us. He has
gotten attached. And though
we have gotten attached, I
will admit I am scared of him.
There is no possible way we
can give him a happy life.
Either way it will hurt him, no dog in the world should have
to go through this. We effed
up. I hate myself so much
right now, and it will be my
fault if this is a continuous
cycle throughout his life. My
husband is sad and I can't even look at my dog without feeling a horrible sense of guilt. I can’t help but hate myself and take all the blame because I'm the one who initially wanted the dog.

820,1667926324,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hey all -

Was watching some videos about leash walking and it made me wonder if I messed things up at the beginning of working with my puppy (he's almost 2 now) and I'm curious if I'd have luck in trying to ""re-train"" leash walking.

To preface - he doesn't pull on the leash at all but he stops and smells every. single. tree/hydrant/fence. and that gets really old, really fast.  He never pulled on the leash when he was a puppy so I never felt the need to work strongly on leash walking skills and I had read how much it wears puppies out mentally to sniff everything so I generally let him do it.  He wasn't leash reactive in the slightest, wasn't pulling like crazy, and he got to sniff and wear himself out.  Win/win/win...or so I thought.

I'm curious though if that taught him that walks are for ""sniffs"" and not actually getting anywhere. (I know he doesn't care about that but I do.) He doesn't pay much attention to me while walking and I have to pull him along every few feet to get off a scent.  I've started on a ""walk"" command (just what I call it) to have him move off a scent and carry on with our walk but that lasts for about 20 seconds before he's right back to sniffing.

I have all the time in the world to train so I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty and knowing this might take a while but I'm a little lost.  I think what sparked it was the leash training videos I was watching showed the dog paying close attention to the handler and that couldn't be further from the truth with my guy.  He's so engrossed in every single smell that he drowns out any commands and shows stubbornness.

Thanks for any help or advice.  

tl;dr Wondering if re-training my almost 2 year old dog on how to leash walk is possible because right now he views walking on leash as a sniffing adventure meant to cover 10 feet instead of the few miles I want to walk him.

(Note that to give her proviable we used some blue Buffalo wet dog food) when this happened I stopped using it and gave her plain chicken and white rice and waited 24 hours to see if she improved. Well she hasnt had an accident in the house but has had diarrhea, it started off orange but 2 days later was light brown and very slimy.

Went to the vet over a rash that my dog has developed. The vet prescribed chlorahexadine and a soothing mousse scrub. I applied the chlorahexadine as soon as we got home and he was fine. That night though, a few hours after applying the mousse, he threw up all his food in bed. It was half digested, no signs of anything other than food. 

So now I’m concerned if one of the medications caused this? He’s acting totally fine. He has plenty of energy, and his appetite is still fine even after throwing up. He seems unbothered but I want to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

My vet said that neither of the medications should cause issue if ingested, so I’m not totally sure?

She’s very high energy, and one night, out of nowhere, while I was shining a laser pointer for her to chase, she became obsessed with shadows.  They’re primarily moving shadows, nothing static, but it really came out of nowhere.  Since she was a little-er guy, she would yell at shadows maybe once a week while taking her out at night.  She was more afraid of the shadows previously, but is now extremely excited by them, wagging her tail profusely the entire time.  

She also licks walls in what seems to be an attempt to get at the shadows.  I’m not an expert with animals at all, but she seems to be producing an insane amount of saliva during this process: she was trying to drag away a pillow that was under my head for less than a minute and left two very large wet spots on the pillow.  There weren’t any water bottles, pipe leaks, or anything else that would’ve caused the spots

853,1667855032,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi all, I have a 6yr old mini dachshund and she has been on apoquel (daily) for around 4yrs due to itching her skin until the point she would lose her hair around her underarms and ears.

It worked fairly well, however during this year she scratched her eye so bad she pulled out her third eyelid (looked like cherry eye). I used to be able to massage it back in as per the vets instructions, however one time it popped out and was too inflamed to be popped back in. She had to have it operated on with two row of stitches. 

In recent weeks, her itching has gotten so bad again and I’m terrified of her hurting her eye badly again. I brought her to the vet again today as I can’t take my eyes off her and instead she’s walking about with one of them blow up donuts on her so she can’t attach her face and eyes. 

The vet gave her a shot of cytopoint to see if things would ease up. It’s been around 12hrs and she’s still dragging her face along the ground. 

I ensured to have the vet check her eyes and teeth in case there was anything bothering her physically but it was all good.

855,1667853337,self.DogAdvice,True,"The actual questions are at the bottom. The rest of this is just me explaining why I think my dog might need a muzzle for walks. This is very long, sorry! 

My dog, Charlie, is pretty reactionary. He loves visiting people, but he's skittish around other dogs. But, needs to get more energy out. Our backyard is fine, but he needs more. Luckily, we live in a very good neighborhood for walking! There's a lot of trees that give shade, the neighbors are typically dog friendly, and there's a park really close by! Two main problems, though: People don't leash their dogs and there's a colony of feral cats. 

There's a lot of factors that go into the first problem, and I can explain if needed, but I'd like to keep this concise. On top of that, dogs can easily break out of the fences, b/c this neighborhood is kind of old and the fences have fallen into disrepair.

Also, there's just a lot of feral cats in this neighborhood. My neighbor's backyard is very overgrown because he doesn't actually live in that house. The tall grass and overgrown bushes are the perfect place for cats to hunt for mice and other small prey. So, they're near our house a lot. Charlie has a prey drive. I absolutely do not want Charlie to catch a cat. But they kind of just roam the neighborhood, and it can be hard to avoid them. Charlie is about 70 to 75 lbs (32 kg to 34 kg) and can overpower me if he really wants to. He hasn't yet, but I know he can. 

Now, the obvious solutions to not being able to walk the neighborhood are dog parks and dog daycares. Charlie doesn't do well at the dog park. It stresses him out &amp; ppl don't always watch their dogs. We usually take the dogs to dog daycare, but it's getting really expensive and we can't afford it. We also have another dog that he can play with, but sometimes he can get stressed out when playing and he starts getting more aggressive. We know how to take care of this, as do the employees at the daycare, but not everyone does and we don't want to just entrust our dog to someone who may not be prepared. So, looking for a cheaper daycare isn't really an option. 

All of this said, I feel like a muzzle would be the easiest thing to do to protect him and others. I haven't talked to my family about this yet, because I'm afraid they'd be all ""muzzle bad!!"" and I want to have some information to give them about why muzzles are not always bad. 

I've done a little bit of research, but I have some questions: Metal/wire basket muzzles are recommended for biting dogs. My dog is not a determined biter. He nips at people who come towards him, but can be more harsh to dogs that come near him. Still not a full-on bite, more of a snap, but do I need a metal/wire muzzle anyway? Since he might chase the cats, should I get a metal muzzle no matter what? Biothane muzzles look a lot more comfortable and friendly, and are advertised to hold up against dogs that nip &amp; snap, but how ""big"" is a nip? Biothane muzzles are also more expensive. Are there any brands you guys would recommend? Preferably cheaper but I'll always take quality over price. As of right now, I'm leaning towards a biothane muzzle, but I want to know more from other dog owners.

Puppy is scheduled to be spayed in a couple of weeks.

Puppy has been having intermittent bathroom issues. My husband works from home every weekday, I am on a hybrid schedule. On the days that I'm not home, he was finding one or two mistakes on the carpet in the living room despite letting her out every 2 hours. To remedy this, we cut off her access to the rest of the house when we work. We each have our offices gated off in a way that allows our yorkie to hop the fence and do as she pleases while the puppy is stuck with one of us unless she asks to leave (at which point we take her outside to pee and give her a chance to get a drink). She was also having issues peeing the bed overnight. We started crating her (much to her dismay) and given our different sleep schedules, she was going about 7.5 hours in her crate without having to pee. We started letting her sleep in the bed with us again and she hasn't had any other issues peeing the bed overnight. We have left the crate set up at the foot of the bed in case we need to go back to using it.

However, today we had a really weird issue. I was cleaning up during my lunch and left the bedroom door open as I toted some laundry out.  I noticed her go trotting into our bedroom. We have a dog bed on top of the crate because the cats like to perch up there. She jumped up into the bed on the crate and started peeing. I hurried over there and picked her up, which caused her to pause, and I went out on the patio with her and kept telling her to ""go potty"" to which she correctly walked o
into the grass and finished. She had been let out an hour and half earlier

Keep in mind, I don't raise my voice at the dogs - the most they've ever gotten is a low pitched ""NO"" if they're trying to eat rabbit poop in the backyard. I didnt even say the word NO when I caught her peeing in the dog bed because I was afraid it might cause her to associate peeing in general as negative. However, this poor dog was clearly upset after coming back in the house even after receiving a treat for finishing her business correctly. She went so far as to go and sulk on the couch in the other room, which is what she does when we've finished something she doesn't enjoy, like getting a bath or cleaning her ears - she didn't even want to follow me back into my office but I managed to coax her in here where she is now curled up and taking a nap.

We've never had issues like this with our other dog, so we're trying to navigate this as properly as possible. I know she's only 7 months old, so I'm not overly concerned about the occasional mistake on a rug - we've come up with ways to circumvent that problem. I'm mainly concerned about her reactions to being redirected away from the things she's doing wrong. Not to anthropomorphize her, but it's like she's super sensitive and gets her feelings hurt if you try to redirect her incorrect behavior. Am I doing something wrong? I'm going to take her to the vet to check for a UTI just in case, but she isn't showing any signs of one besides the accidents.

Any help would be appreciated.",1,"7 mo poodle bathroom issues, sensitive to redirection",text,656,"['7', 'mo', 'poodle', 'bathroom', 'issue', 'sensitive', 'redirection', 'rehomed', 'female', 'miniature', 'poodle', '4', 'month', 'old', 'time', 'got', 'already', '4th', 'house', 'passed', 'family', 'family', 'couldnt', 'properly', 'care', 'also', 'spayed', 'adult', 'yorkie', 'mix', 'get', 'along', 'great', 'puppy', 'scheduled', 'spayed', 'couple', 'weekspuppy', 'intermittent', 'bathroom', 'issue', 'husband', 'work', 'home', 'every', 'weekday', 'hybrid', 'schedule', 'day', 'im', 'home', 'finding', 'one', 'two', 'mistake', 'carpet', 'living', 'room', 'despite', 'letting', 'every', '2', 'hour', 'remedy', 'cut', 'access', 'rest', 'house', 'work', 'office', 'gated', 'way', 'allows', 'yorkie', 'hop', 'fence', 'plea', 'puppy', 'stuck', 'one', 'u', 'unless', 'asks', 'leave', 'point', 'take', 'outside', 'pee', 'give', 'chance', 'get', 'drink', 'also', 'issue', 'peeing', 'bed', 'overnight', 'started', 'crating', 'much', 'dismay', 'given', 'different', 'sleep', 'schedule', 'going', '75', 'hour', 'crate', 'without', 'pee', 'started', 'letting', 'sleep', 'bed', 'u', 'hasnt', 'issue', 'peeing', 'bed', 'overnight', 'left', 'crate', 'set', 'foot', 'bed', 'case', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'using', 'ithowever', 'today', 'really', 'weird', 'issue', 'cleaning', 'lunch', 'left', 'bedroom', 'door', 'open', 'toted', 'laundry', 'noticed', 'go', 'trotting', 'bedroom', 'dog', 'bed', 'top', 'crate', 'cat', 'like', 'perch', 'jumped', 'bed', 'crate', 'started', 'peeing', 'hurried', 'picked', 'caused', 'pause', 'went', 'patio', 'kept', 'telling', 'go', 'potty', 'correctly', 'walked', 'ointo', 'grass', 'finished', 'let', 'hour', 'half', 'earlierkeep', 'mind', 'dont', 'raise', 'voice', 'dog', 'theyve', 'ever', 'gotten', 'low', 'pitched', 'theyre', 'trying', 'eat', 'rabbit', 'poop', 'backyard', 'didnt', 'even', 'say', 'word', 'caught', 'peeing', 'dog', 'bed', 'afraid', 'might', 'cause', 'associate', 'peeing', 'general', 'negative', 'however', 'poor', 'dog', 'clearly', 'upset', 'coming', 'back', 'house', 'even', 'receiving', 'treat', 'finishing', 'business', 'correctly', 'went', 'far', 'go', 'sulk', 'couch', 'room', 'weve', 'finished', 'something', 'doesnt', 'enjoy', 'like', 'getting', 'bath', 'cleaning', 'ear', 'didnt', 'even', 'want', 'follow', 'back', 'office', 'managed', 'coax', 'curled', 'taking', 'napweve', 'never', 'issue', 'like', 'dog', 'trying', 'navigate', 'properly', 'possible', 'know', 'shes', '7', 'month', 'old', 'im', 'overly', 'concerned', 'occasional', 'mistake', 'rug', 'weve', 'come', 'way', 'circumvent', 'problem', 'im', 'mainly', 'concerned', 'reaction', 'redirected', 'away', 'thing', 'shes', 'wrong', 'anthropomorphize', 'like', 'shes', 'super', 'sensitive', 'get', 'feeling', 'hurt', 'try', 'redirect', 'incorrect', 'behavior', 'something', 'wrong', 'im', 'going', 'take', 'vet', 'check', 'uti', 'case', 'isnt', 'showing', 'sign', 'one', 'besides', 'accidentsany', 'help', 'would', 'appreciated']", mo poodle bathroom issue sensitive redirection rehomed female miniature poodle  month old time got already th house passed family family couldnt properly care also spayed adult yorkie mix get along great puppy scheduled spayed couple weekspuppy intermittent bathroom issue husband work home every weekday hybrid schedule day im home finding one two mistake carpet living room despite letting every  hour remedy cut access rest house work office gated way allows yorkie hop fence plea puppy stuck one u unless asks leave point take outside pee give chance get drink also issue peeing bed overnight started crating much dismay given different sleep schedule going  hour crate without pee started letting sleep bed u hasnt issue peeing bed overnight left crate set foot bed case need go back using ithowever today really weird issue cleaning lunch left bedroom door open toted laundry noticed go trotting bedroom bed top crate like perch jumped bed crate started peeing hurried picked caused pause went patio kept telling go potty correctly walked ointo grass finished let hour half earlierkeep mind dont raise voice theyve ever gotten low pitched theyre trying eat rabbit poop backyard didnt even say word caught peeing bed afraid might cause associate peeing general negative however poor clearly upset coming back house even receiving treat finishing business correctly went far go sulk couch room weve finished something doesnt enjoy like getting bath cleaning ear didnt even want follow back office managed coax curled taking napweve never issue like trying navigate properly possible know shes  month old im overly concerned occasional mistake rug weve come way circumvent problem im mainly concerned reaction redirected away thing shes wrong anthropomorphize like shes super sensitive get feeling hurt try redirect incorrect behavior something wrong im going take vet check uti case isnt showing sign one besides accidentsany help would appreciated

860,1667845925,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello, folks! Good day to all!

So as the title says I am ready at last to get my own standard poodle. My favorite breed of dogs. My sister has a small one but she is not a good source of information.

Just to get it out of the way - I know that owning a dog is costly and I work from home. I chose the standard breed as I am rather active for longer walks and prefer the bigger size dog.

Few questions.

I am looking for an 8 weeks old puppy and I know that first half the year we need to be together all the time. But will I be able to live him home alone at 8 months as I usually spend weekend riding my motorcycle?

We live in a two story apartment - is it ok if the puppy sleeps on the first floor from the beginning as the cabinet is the most comfy and warm room?

My workplace has pet insurance for funny money - like $ 10 a month. Does it worth it?

Do you have experience in leaving the dog in daycare for a few days. I googled and there a re plenty with $65 a day separate room.

We also have a parrot. He is mature smart and coward. Usually he is pretty quiet, but when he is worried - as he sees a new face he may scream a few times. And this is not a good experience. Will it be very detrimental for a pup?

How easy(or hard) is keep a male poodle without neutering him? Do I get him a doll or there is like a circle of owners that let their pets copulate?

Also, what is ""a must"" when I purchase a pup? Some of them are reputable breeders and want $ 3000 for a pup with a waiting list about a year. Others are twice less than that and available but is it OK if they are not AKC registered? Also, I am definitely not going to participate in shows or making money out of puppies.

865,1667836037,self.DogAdvice,True,"We have an 11-month old husky who has gotten increasingly destructive as he has gotten older. I am pretty sure it is due to boredom, and would like to give him more stimulation to help. Currently he gets a walk at night, but I'm considering adding one in the morning (I don't think one walk a day is enough anymore; when he was younger it was)

Something to note is our setup: both my husband and I work out of the house all day. We have another dog as well. They both have access to the dog door (fenced-in backyard) so they can come and go as they please while we're away. While this helps with not needing to take them out for bathroom breaks during the day, it also means that we can't give him puzzles or other interactive toys because the other dog will take them from him, and we can't separate them during the day because they both need access to the backyard

I think my best option is longer walks and also walking him in the morning, but I'm not sure if that will help, or how long a walk needs to be to really keep him interested and tired out. I was also thinking of giving him a puzzle in the morning before I leave for work? He is currently not crated, but we are also considering that as an option.

868,1667828605,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hey.  


Three months ago we got a doberman pup, it's our second doberman after our previous one crossed the bridge to dog heaven due to old age, a year ago.

We try as much as possible to not leave him alone at home as we already know from experience these dogs are clingy to their owners and are prone to seperation anxiety.  
Sadly, things don't always work out, and from time to time he has to spend some alone time at home. Of course he always has access to food, water, toys and sometimes even a bone to keep him busy.   
The issue is, that when left alone he becomes a different dog, and I don't think I have to be a dog psychiatrist to determine it is seperation anxiety.   


He immideatly starts.. screaming? I don't think barking or whining with any adjective would describe what that is. He doesn't destroy anything, and most of the time he won't even pee or poop  on the floor. He just stands at the door, for an hour or more, barking and whining like crazy. I can hear it from a block away, it's non stop. I'm not sure he even breathes while at it.  
Luckily for us we live in a dog friendly country, else the neighbours would sue us already and honeslty I can't blame them. 

Then when I open the door it's like I have returned from overseas and he hasn't seen me in years, even though I wasn't out for more than 10 minutes. 10. minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

What can be done? Should I try a trainer\*? I haven't had this experience with any dog in my life and neither has anyone I know. I don't even care about the neighbours, seriously, f them. I just don't want him to feel that way. it breaks my heart.

869,1667826650,self.DogAdvice,True,"backstory: I have a Shiba Inu mix (lab, pit bull, shepherd) named Sabrina. 1.5 years old. Ever since she was a puppy she has been quiet not one to play or lick your face, really timid. Our groomer even was asking if she was abused before we got her because of how shy and jumpy she is. She has NEVER been hit. She is crate trained. We are moving across country (literally coast to coast) and are staying at my moms for the time being. Brother passed 1.5 weeks ago while we were here.

Her brother passed due to old age and she was always attached to him. She was less timid around him. Now she has scratched the wall up when my mom was home sleeping and everyone else was gone and is pooping and peeing in the house. When she is let out she will just scratch the door unless I walk her or stand outside with her which I have been doing. But if I even go to the bathroom with the door shut she will piddle or poop on the floor even after just going outside. She follows me everywhere. I have also been bringing her with me everywhere I go. When I do leave her for short periods she is in her cage but when I return she is inconsolably excited/relieved for 5+ minutes crying, panting, and whimpering. She is stuck to me like glue. She has also developed a dislike for other dogs, even nipped at my brothers dogs and his puppy and a dog at the dog park. She listens to commands almost immediately and knows the basics sit, stay, lie down, and paw. What can I do to help my grieving puppy? I know she must be exhausted from the move as well.

Hi, can someone please give me some advice. Bonfire night was on Saturday and my wee dog was really terrified from the noise and stuff.

I took her for a walk this morning on the lead and her tail was down, she was pulling on the lead like she wanted to run home and she kept shaking every time she stopped.

871,1667824364,self.DogAdvice,True,"Over the past week, my 6yo Cairn Terrier X has  been a very fussy eater. Her meal sits there until its almost her next mealtime and she reluctantly eats from my hand. Tonight she's just not interested in food even by hand. Her teeth are fine and she's drinking water. Her belly doesn't feel tender.

We've tried swapping to the dry and wet bland the vet gave us after tummy troubles (found KFC in the park!). Not interested. She's happy to have treats on walks and we gave her a raw chicken wing on Sunday which she ate with gusto. She has eaten a couple of zucchini scraps and a piece of steamed pumpkin tonight. I put her meal in the snuffle mat and Kong bowl but she's just not interested.

She's normally a fast eater and she gets grain free dry food after her hour long walk before and after work.  I work from home and give her some wet food in a kong during my lunch.

But when john sees her, he’ll just bark his brains out scaring giz into a retreat making it hard for her to want to explore ): The only XP Giz has with dogs is just the very infrequent few day intervals with extreme supervision.

882,1667793891,self.DogAdvice,True,"Dudes... I have no idea what I'm doing. My 2 yr old Bichon Frise has not been socialized and we just never thought we would get another dog. We are her entire world. But since I've been able to stay home and pull my head out my ass, I noticed that she actually might need a sibling. 


So I agreed with my husband's wish to get a golden retriever. We figured the energy level would be great match. 

We've googled and YouTube how to raise this new pup, wanting to avoid the mistakes made with our Bichon. But what we didn't consider, stupidly and ironically, was how to help them get along. 


1. We thought she was going to be bigger..and totally forgot what an infant pup with pirahana teeth was like

2. Although we were so ignorant and made many mistakes with Bichon, it was easier to just focus on her. Training a new pup and showering her with do much attention, with a dog that has been spoiled all her life is a challenge I just didn't anticipate. 


Our Bichon might pull on the leash and doesn't know any traditional commands but she is actually a very polite and sweet girl. 



We were warned by the breeder that this Golden pup was ""anti-social"" as compared to her more social butterfly sister. Breeder seemed nervous about our Bichon getting along with her but Golden came right to us, fell asleep in our arms, and seemed to be indifferent about Bichon.


This will be our 2nd night with the new babe. I know she's only an infant and has only been with us for 48 hours. But my Bichon seems to be going through a mix of emotions and I have little idea of how go help transition together.


Golden wants to cuddle with us, naturally. Bichon is keeping her distance because Golden has asked for space... So Bichon doesn't get to cuddle or be close with us. 

It seems like Bichon is mostly curious, sometimes tries to ""correct"" Golden with boops or light display of dominance and Golden will lie down/show belly. But for the most part she stares from a distances, takes the opportunity to sniff the baby when she is sleeping, and is *incredibly* tolerant when Golden nips her. 

I mean, she's latched onto her lip with them shark teeth and my a Bichon just stood still, she never reacts even when her tail is being bitten. This hasn't happened often, we try to keep them separate and make them respect space if they are rowdy. 


Invitation to play turns into annoyance or fear because it seems Bichon is unsure how to play with this baby.. and Golden nips or gets irritated with the darting around. 


It honestly makes me sad that it appears my Bichon is trying to figure out this new friend, wants to play but doesn't know how, and is also dealing with her home and family being taken over. 

I feel like an utter failure. I'm heart broken over how poorly my beloved 2 yr old has been socialized and seems to want a friend so badly. And I'm frustrated that I can watch all the videos on dog body language but it seems like it all goes through one ear and out the other, not to mention with all the different methods and opinions and advise that seems to conflict. 

I'm worried they may never get along, because these first few weeks/month are so important and that I'm fucking it up by either intervening with the way they figure things out or allowing bad habits. 


So far they eat well together, sometimes sleep near each other.. but mostly keep a distance. 

I will be crate training Golden as advised by the breeder. I'm hoping to also work on training my Bichon. 

Any advice about how to facilitate their relationship is much appreciated. I genuinely wanted a sibling for my Bichon, not to just get another dog. 

I'm also considering getting a trainer for them both? I don't know how young is too young for that but I feel like I need the help...

883,1667793097,self.DogAdvice,True,"OK so I've got a Pitbull-Terrier/German Sheppard Mix who's a little over one year old. We got her at 4 months old. I'm a truck driver, so she went on the road with me for about 4 months while I worked on training her, getting to know her, and bonding with her.

Originally we thought the fear was just because of a new environment, so we did as we were advised by vet and trainer, and gave it time, hoping she'd adjust. After 4 months of her ultimately shutting down while I drove and opening up, getting playful and happy when I parked, we realized it wasn't a ""new environment"", but instead a fear of a vehicle in motion. Stop lights, stop signs, parked, as long as it's not moving she is 100% open and happy. So sadly I pulled her off the truck and she's become my wife's dog. Except when the wife comes out with me once a year.

Just got done with the wife being out with me for 2 weeks and Snowball has acted a lot more comfortable this time due to the wife being on the truck. Vet has made a few suggestions about it maybe being motion sickness, so we tried motion sickness medications (no effect), tried a thunder wrap jacket which makes her feel like she's being hugged all the time which has helped quite a bit, but not solved the issue. We also set her crate up which is what she feels is her safe space, which is frankly where she spent most of her time while we were moving.

I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and if there is anything we can do to make her more comfortable during the occasion ride? Obviously I'll never be able to bring her back on the truck full time, I wouldn't dream of it considering her obvious fear of riding, but it would be nice if she wasn't so scared when going to the vet, to the park, to the pet store, etc etc.

Recently read CBD might help. We know she deals with SEVERE separation anxiety (this was from before we got her, but being with me on the truck 24/7 probably didn't help that issue), but don't know if that's related to the fear of the vehicles moving.

If anyone has any suggestions it would be extremely helpful.

892,1667781541,self.DogAdvice,True,"Yesterday, I adopted a sheltie gsd mix from my cousin, who's roommate had puppies and needed to rehome them. They had their first few vaccines and a dewormer. This is relevant later in my post. Yesterday, when the puppy came home, he met my 4 y/o male GSD outside in our backyard. I recognize this may not be the best way to introduce them, but I do not have the possibility to introduce them another way. At first, he was just very curious of the puppy and was sniffing him a lot, and the puppy was laying on his back very submissively while my older dog examined him. Then, once the puppy started to move, my GSD tried to grab him and the puppy yelped. When this happened, my GSD went into what I call ""lock mode"" and he tried to go after my puppy. I picked him up and walked away, and my family members helped by taking my GSD inside and I put my puppy in the crate I set up for him. It is near our living room and dining room. My GSD was highly anxious, panting a lot and just standing outside of his crate. He would occasionally bark playfully at my puppy, but once or twice it was a firm and unhappy bark. My puppy seemed really scared, and once we took out my GSD I took out the puppy from his crate. He projectile diarrhea all over the living room, I'm guessing from stress or fear. Once he was cleaned and settled he was calm, but he started having bad diarrhea for the rest of the evening and today as well. I would take him in front by himself on a loose leash and he would poop, he is a very smart puppy and is already house trained in just one day. Today his diarrhea was basically water, and I called so many vets and animal hospitals, but none were open since its Sunday. I was fearing he maybe had Parvo or Giardia.  I took him to my dad's camper on his truck since it was a nice breezy day and we didn't want to risk my other dog getting sick. I set up his kennel in there and he seemed to like that environment much more. He ate rice, boiled chicken and carrots to soothe his stomach and he drank lots of water, and was so relaxed he even took a nice nap, which he hadn't been able to do since yesterday. He was very playful with me and was cuddly as well. I spoke to my cousin and he agreed to take him for the rest of the day to see if the better environment, or one that he was used to, would help his symptoms. Once we arrived at his house, he was very happy to see his dad and he immediately went to play with him, and then went to lay down on his belly on the kitchen tiles, very relaxed. Then he went into his kennel where I left him, and he was eating more of the mix I packed for him. Now I am wondering if the issue was my GSD, since he was so vigilant about him and would not let him rest. Every time he would move, my GSD would come running up to the crate and watched his every move. I am scared that maybe I am not the right home for him. I understand it takes hard work to raise a puppy and I am ready for that, but I also do not want to risk my GSD hurting my puppy intentionally or by accident. I also do not want the puppy to suffer from extreme stress and fear, when he could be in another calmer environment. He is such a sweet and gentle puppy that I want the best for him, but I have also grown so attached to him already and he has with me as well. I am very conflicted and don't know what to do. Puppy has a vet appointment tomorrow to rule out any viral or bacterial infections. I was thinking of hiring a trainer to help with their assimilation process, but I don't know if this should be done for both of them or just for my GSD.

902,1667767837,self.DogAdvice,True,"English is not my first language so I apologise for the misspelling 

My dog (I’m going to call him T) is 3 y/o, he is kinda large (25 kilos), VERY strong and incredibly rough in the way he plays. He never hurt anyone, what I mean is: he doesn’t realise how big he is in comparison to others so he plays as if everyone is his size

What happened today: I was on my way to the park with T and my 11 y/o cousin and she wanted to walk him and take the leash. Out of nowhere, T starts pulling really hard bc he saw a another dog, but it was so rough that my cousin almost fell to the ground and he went straight to the other dog. It took me a solid 2 seconds to realise what was happening and grab him by the harness. 

Honestly, idk if T was trying to play, but thankfully the other dog took it like a champ. Understandably, the owner was livid and started yelling at me but I was so shocked that I don’t even know if I apologised. 

Like an idiot I still took him to the park (6 blocks away) and on the way he wanted to greet a random woman so I got furious and grabbed him by the harness, again, but this time all the way to the park.

When I got to the park I went to the place all the dogs are and T was playing like usual but when he got tired and was laying next to us. A puppy came and started being cute and giving us kisses. I thought it was weird that T didn’t react at all cause normally he just looks at me and jumps to get my attention, but I though nothing of it (again, stupid). After the fourth time the puppy came, he accidentally stepped on T’s ball and T went crazy, started growling and tried to stand up. I grabbed him so nothing happened but I got furious. When I was scolding him the puppy’s owners were apologising profusely and I was apologising to them, too.

We took him home and he behaved perfectly on our way back. I’m guessing because he could tell I was pissed.

This never happened before, I’m so angry and so worried. What if hurts a dog next time?

To start, I want to say that I have a vet appointment on Monday. This is just out of curiosity.

A month or so ago, I noticed my dogs lip area was turning red. Behind the whiskers, on the snout near the lips. It hasn’t gotten worse, but it hasn’t gotten better. There are also tiny little scab looking bumps. It’s hard to notice the redness unless it’s in direct light. He doesn’t appear to be itchy, and it doesn’t seem to bother him. I don’t know what it could be? Any ideas or tips?

Hopefully it’s an easy fix at the vet.

920,1667741508,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello!

A couple years back my dog had a parasite and due to this had a major lack of appetite. My vet at the time said he was probably having gastrointestinal issues and told me to switch to a lower fat kibble. Since then (it’s been years) I finally found the Hills Science diet weight management kibble that he does eat (although we pretty much have to now top it with other fatty options to get him to eat it). It’s a minimum 8% crude fat. I was told to look for MAX 8% in the past but the minimum is fine.

However, my dog isn’t getting fat, he isn’t gaining weight, he has normal poops and is a happy 5 year old. I would really like to switch him to a better, richer kibble that he deserves without crazy toppers like chicken or goat milk!

I’ve been looking at grain-inclusive options between open farm, orijen or jignature. Although the lowest crude fat minimum is 15%.

Has anyone’s vet ever told them something similar? I fear that this is advice he once gave me based off assumption and the last thing I want is to harm my boys tummy? What do you think?

927,1667734188,self.DogAdvice,True,"When we got our 2 year old Bichon, we had no idea what we were doing and were afraid of noise violation when crate training so we just didn't crate train her. We like sleeping with her and so that's been our dynamic. 

However, we picked up an 8 week old Golden Retriever yesterday and we are wiser now, having learned from our mistakes with our first pup. We *do* plan to crate train her and more or less know how but there are different opinions about crating the first handful of nights at this age. Something about making them feel safe and building confidence. 

This is important to me and from her perspective, she's just been taken from mama and littermates. So  I'm posting at 4 AM, having had maybe 2 hours of sleep total, wondering when I can start fucking crating her lol

Some articles say I can expedite her sleeping through the night by crating. I'm just worried that she'll associate it with being isolated and scared. I want this crate training to go as smoothly as possible. Of course I'll train throughout the day too. 

Each time she's gotten rowdy or whined, I took her out of our bed to go potty and she's peed. She'll come back to bed, play a little, then sleep. So it's not to crazy. I'm just looking at... what? 8 more weeks of sleep deprivation? 

Is it normal for me to just lose sleep until she is fully potty trained and sleeping in her crate? I guess it wouldn't be the first time I went insomniac for several weeks lol. 

Am I wrong to let her sleep with us for a while? If it helps build security and confidence.. how soon do you think I should start trying to crate her at night?

937,1667708812,self.DogAdvice,True,"A year ago, my family adopted a 5.5 y/o supposed Pomeranian/Lhasa Apso from the local shelter. We neutered him, got him groomed, and fixed his ear infection. We were told he had a bite history but it was implied it was one time &amp; was regarding touching his sensitive infected ears.

He is cured to my knowledge from the infection. He is VERY cuddly and loves attention. He’s overall a sweetheart! But sometimes he can have triggers that turns him into a “Mr. Hyde”, and it does not appear to be a fear response. I’m talking when he doesn’t want to get off the couch, leave the car he hopped into unexpectedly, have his toy he suddenly decided to protect be approached, or be prevented from eating poop (cat, dog, doesn’t matter). 

A trainer we saw with him suggested a drag leash to be able to pull him away from his trigger which helped a lot towards protecting everyone involved. He immediately acts like nothing happened! However… he’s banned from the groomers, at least for nail trimming I think, because he’s bitten the groomers too many times. One groomer was bitten during the cutting process &amp; she finished the next day, the next groomer was bitten while trimming the nails to the point she had to leave and seek care. 

I’ve heard a veterinary behavioralist might be able to help? Haven’t gotten to look into too deeply, but I know it may be pricey. Just wondering if there is any other options to explore before splurging on a potential mystery box.

We started antibiotics and few days later, the culture test turned out negative so she said it’s probably not a uti. Possible vaginitis but it’s hard to diagnose.

943,1667699632,self.DogAdvice,True,"TL;DR: I have tried everything I can think of to get my dog to eat his prescribed joint supplement on a regular basis, but I cannot get him to do so short of shoving it down his throat. Putting it in his food is not a viable option for regular consumption. Need creative ideas to coax/trick him into eating it (it can be crushed into a powder). Peanut butter and cheese don’t work. :(

I need some very creative suggestions here. My 9 year old Bichon was prescribed a joint supplement to be on for the rest of his life, but I cannot for the life of me get him to regularly consume it. Our journey so far: day one, he ate it on its own after I cut it into small pieces fairly happily. Day two, he refused to do this so I wrapped the small pieces in some cheese and this worked for another 2-3 days. Then he began to somehow eat just the cheese around it (all while keeping it inside his mouth) and then spit out the joint supplement piece inside. Okay, fine. I started to crush it into a powder and put it in his breakfast since he gets wet food with each meal, and this worked fine for a bit until he decided to go on a few day fast (which is not atypical for him, so please disregard this fact. He is otherwise healthy and always eats normally within 3-4 days). New plan was to crush it into the powder and put it into peanut butter so he couldn’t physically eat any part of it without consuming the supplement. I implemented the plan this morning, and I kid you not, my dog who loves peanut butter did not touch it. I am at my wits end, and short of forcing him to eat it like a pill (which I REALLY don’t want to do), I am out of ideas. He must be able to smell the supplement in everything and he clearly doesn’t like the taste.

951,1667691848,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog Boston (8 y/o) has been acting out recently, and I can’t figure out why but I feel like I’m at my wits end. This has been happening slowly for the last maybe 3 months, but getting progressively worse the last month or so. 

She won’t go outside, and when she does she doesn’t go pee or poo, she just stands around. Then she’ll come inside and do her business inside afterwards. Not as many pees inside but lots of poos. 

She won’t eat her food all day then down it right before bedtime so she usually has to go bathroom in the middle of the night. I’m worried if I put her food/water up at a certain time she’ll go the whole day without eating? 

She hasn’t been listening to her usual commands at all (go outside, out of the kitchen, gentle, even just “no”, etc.) and just ignoring us in general. She’s also been sniffing on top of tables/counters and even sniffing plates- all of the above she knows not to do and never did before. 

The two biggest changes that I think could be triggering all of this: back in June we had one of our other dogs put down, they were quite close. The other thing is that I’m currently 8 months pregnant, so maybe she can sense the change coming? 

She’s been to the vet and her health is in usual order (she has arthritis in her hips but that’s controlled with medication). She does have anxiety but usually just when she’s out of the house or around new people.

955,1667682196,self.DogAdvice,True,"I want to preface this by saying I AM NOT willingly adopting a cat just because. This cat was my dad’s cat and he just passed away. No one else will take her and I do love this cat. It’s a piece of him that I want to keep. The only issue is I have a hyper dog. We think he is a border collie/catahoula mix so he is quite intense. He loves to stare down cats outside and would probably chase them if I let him. We fostered kittens once before and he was absolutely fascinated by them. He would sit by the closed door and sniff and would get so excited when the put their paws under the door. When I would hold the kittens, he would cry and want to sniff them. My dad’s cat is a grouch and has no fear. I’ve seen her chase a 70 pound pitbull across the parking lot and throw herself at windows because a raccoon walked by. I have a spare bedroom that I plan on keeping her in for an extended period just to kind of depressurize. Is there any hope of my dog and cat coexisting? I know they will never be best buddies but I worry about the dog chasing her and then her whipping around and attacking him which obviously wouldn’t end well. How can I train him to leave her alone and let them get used to each other without stressing each other out? He is crate trained so I thought of putting him in his crate with a kong and letting her explore after a month or two of just being in the bedroom. I also don’t want her to be locked in a bedroom for the rest of her life because they don’t get along. I appreciate any helpful advice!

958,1667672217,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog (female, almost 2 y/o) doesn't like it if I talk to or pet other dogs. If I do this, she'll usually jump up on me as if to remind me that *she's* my dog. She has a few times kind of ""pushed"" other dogs away/""slapped"" them if I interact with them, but today she did something she's never done before:

We were walking (she's on a lead), we ran into another dog that we see every now and then, on a lead with her owner as well, and as my dog loves all other dogs, she wanted to say hello, and so did the other dog. They went through the usual spiel of sniffing, playfully jumping around etc. when the other dog comes over to sniff me. My dog immediately (I hadn't even acknowledged the other dog yet) jumps up on the other dog's back and kind of grabs her - it looked like when a male dog tries to mount a female dog. I had never seen her do anything like it, and she did it twice on this encounter, both in the context of the other dog showing a very subtle interest in me.

Does anyone else have dogs that are like this? Is it likely to turn into aggression, and what can I do to turn this around?

Also, I interpret this is jealousy, but I'm not 100% sure if that's what it is, either.

983,1667614104,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hey ya'll firstly I'm a new dog owner and have been learning a lot, but recently my dog bolted off and it was a frightening situation so I'm wondering how to go able handling it.

For some context, and yes this will make me seem very irresponsible but like I said I'm new to all of this and still learning the boundaries and relationship you have with dogs, so I did make a mistake and hopefully have been able to properly identify where I went wrong to learn.

So I got my Amstafg from a shelter July, 5 years old yet he's very sweet and affectionate, very obedient and responsive when at home. I've asked before here about leash training and will be working on that soon, but to re-explain here, he gets very excited and pulls hard on the leash. The shelter gave me a muzzle halti but it feels awful and he hates it so I've just got a harness and been slowly working with him, more just trying to get him out and get used to the area rather than training him.

Anyway, the otherday I left the front door open to take out trash, now he is such a good boy with 0 training he doesnt run away even as I left him at the open front door and went to the back of the house (please let me know if this is bad for whatever reason, I just trusted him) and he even came out and hung around me out the front, slowly beginning to walk off but once he left my ""orbit"" I said No and called him back, he would come sit next to me and I gave him some pets and praised him.

Now in hindsight I realise he was starting to get more and more excited the more he did it, only about 3 times, then I took the bin around the corner and he sniffed around a bit, as I turn around to call him back he just bolted.

He wouldn't listen to anything I would say or respond at all, only running further and faster away the closer I got. Eventually I got him back.

I don't blame him I'm sure from his perspective he thinks he did nothing wrong and just got to run around for a bit, I realise I should have noticed his excitement and praised him for the good behaviour and then put him inside to calm down. 

I'm wondering to anyone who is willing to offer advice, is there anyway to train this behaviour? Or is he just too excitable outside to be left unleashed? What might have been his reasoning or his behaviour or thought process to make him bolt and stop listening?

990,1667601920,self.DogAdvice,True,"Disclaimer: this is just an opinion, singular POV, everyone has different experiences with raising dogs and use of hyperbolic language is used to highlight a particular point. So let's be nice to each other.

Whenever someone has a particular fear or intense dislike of a certain breed of dog I always think it's because they struggle to pick up on other people's emotions when they're looking at that person's face.

For example, when a scary looking man shows no emotion on their face while making direct eye contact with you it's very unsettling. Imagine not being able to look at a dog and figure out how that dog is feeling in that moment. You wouldn't be able to effectively raise that dog without being able to pick up on it's emotional energy so you can steer the dog towards the correct behaviour. 

When young and learning your mind is very plastic. Puppy's seem to have a way they go through life in those early stages. Which is made easier to keep the puppy calm when you know how to react to it's actions. When a 15kg ball of cunt comes bundling at you, barking and growling like something kicked it in the nut sack, shaking like a cat shitting razorblades. And you panic, then you're only going to make the fucker freak out more by acting like an absolute twat and screaming your head off. You'll be raising a toddler killing machine by the time of it's 4th year or worse getting your face eaten while you're sleeping.

Just get a toy breed instead as you're clearly looking for a baby to keep basically from cradle to grave. Log on to the KC, check the inbreeding coefficient percentages of ancestral lines for 8 generations of Cavapoo and make sure that puppy doesn't have any illnesseses or genetic disorders that cripple the fucker all 7 long years of its aching life.

Or better yet, grab a mutt thats been moved 7 times in 1.5 years that desperately wants to maul another child due to its terrier traits.

Fucking waste of time. People make bad mistakes all the time. People get hurt in all sorts of ways because of our mistakes. Just stop fighting with each other about how to properly stop this issue. Whether it be kill all of them and make some dumpster meat or it's all love #nobaddogonlybadowners both camps make me sick.

There's a wealth of knowledge out there about how to raise great dogs of all breeds, whether you want smashed and slammed or pure bred crufts champion. It's easy to understand what each dog breed requires to not grow up a dick so it lives a long and healthy life.

Stop pretending you know more than others because you watched 75 hours of Yankies breeding the love out of GSDs through ""what to do to raise a great German Shepherd and why they're the perfect canine companions"".

992,1667599165,self.DogAdvice,True,"I live in a block of flats, with narrow hallways on each floor, which connect lifts, the stairwell and the doors of the individual units. My neighbour has 2 chihuahuas and her door is just next to the lifts, so I need to wait there for the lifts and get off there when exiting the lifts. One of her dogs bit me two times. 

First, she opened the door and the dog immediately ran out and bit the back of my leg, in less than 2 seconds, as I was waiting less then 2 meters from her door for the lift (the lifts are exactly near her door). She did not apologise, but asked me if the dog did me any damage and then just took the dog back in an slammed the door. Second time, her dog ran into the lift when I was returning home, and in less the 2 seconds bit my shoe. She was in her flat, but left the door open for some reason and the dogs were on the hallway. She also opens the door, and lets the dogs out on the hallway while they wear extensible leads, and they act aggressively towards me when i exit the lift and then get in the lift WHILE WEARING LEADS (so they might get strangled if someone calls the lift).

I tried to talk to her, but was impossible. She yelled that her dogs never bite, and when they bite it doesn’t matter as they are smaller then cats (yes, great logic). The she proceeded to yell “do you want me to sacrifice them? Do you want to go to the police?” with her kids present, while I told her that I just wanted the dogs to wear leads and not be unsupervised, as bites can get infected. So talking to the woman is out of the question, and I am trying to reason with the dogs instead.

I had 3 dogs as a kid (ex-stray dogs in the countryside so very different setup) and never seen this behaviour. My guess is that the chihuahua that bit me is super territorial and thinks the hallway is his home too, and is probably scared when seeing strangers. So far I tried talking to it calmly, calling it cutes names, and pushing him away with my bag when it tries to jump at my ankles. But this is getting ridiculous. I started having my phone ready to record and further interactions, as the owner of f the dogs calls me a liar even if she saw the first bite. I don’t want to sue or anything like that, but in this province the authorities will make the owner vaccinate the dog for rabies/do some classes if you prove they bite (rabies vaccine is not mandatory otherwise which is stupid - this is a rabies free country in Europe except few incidents).

993,1667597807,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I have a female cocker, aged 3. She was spayed later in life and has a habit of marking territory. Before anyone asks, we’ve ruled out medical issues with a vet. 

She marks multiple times during walks (the smallest amounts), marks after seeing another dog, has marked on her new beds, and if shes in someone else’s house she will try to mark indoors despite being house trained. It’s not super often that she will mark indoors, but it’s unpredictable enough to where I get nervous bringing her to someone’s house.

We don’t know yet if she will ever stop the behavior, but I don’t want this to mean she can’t come with us on adventures. And I certainly don’t want it to mean I have to board her when I want to see family out of concern for her marking habits. She’s perfect to me and holds her bladder just fine, it’s just that she marks sometimes. 

Anyway, are dog diapers a good solution to this? I would only have them on her when she is indoors at a stranger’s house. I trust she wouldn’t release a bladder’s worth of pee into it.

We rescued our now 6.5 year old (""D"") from a littermate syndrome home life... it was not a good one, it was to the point the siblings were fighting pretty bad and he has scars from it.

4,1669608405,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi! I adopted a 3 year old cat 10 days ago(I know it’s not very long ago) and he’s been doing alright. Eating and drinking well, playing a little bit and exploring. However at the shelter they said he was very vocal and liked to be petted with chin scratches and behind the ears, but he won’t let me nor my parents even close to him. If we try and reach out he shys away and I’m scared this will become a problem for vet visits, maintaining his fur and checking him for ticks etc. during the summer. He doesn’t run away and hide but he seems very uncomfortable with hands in general. I’ve been trying to work with him by first giving him a treat and walk to the other side of the room then proceeding to get closer every time he gets a treat to gain his trust. I’m at the point where he will most of the time eat it from my hand but backs off if I move my hand afterwards. When I do have a treat in my hand he will eat it and lick my hand for a while afterwards. He also sniffs our feet and sometimes hands but if I try and pretend to have a treat to get him close he won’t bat an eye and just stare at me. The first three days he only laid under our sofa but he’s been starting to lay in the sofa and around on the floor now but sometimes hides under the sofa again(which is totally fine as he probably like the fact that he gets space but still can be aware of where we are) He always follow us around and wants to be around us but at a distance.  I know I haven’t had him for long and that he’s probably still getting used to a new house and family but I worry that he won’t ever be more comfortable for his sake. We don’t know what he has been through but we know he was found on a landfill but he was already neutered but not chipped so someone either left him there or he was let outside too early and got lost. I’m just very stressed that I’m doing something wrong or it wasn’t a good fit comparing to the two previous cats I’ve had. 

The other things is that for the past two days he’s beeen laying next to our balcony door or looking outside the window on the door meowing a lot as if he really wants to go outside but I dont want to let him outside before I know he’s fully comfortable and knows that this is his home and where to return and since it’s winter I was planning on just keeping him inside till spring because where I live it snows, freezing temps and there’s only two hours of daylight during winter time and if he were to get lost or trapped he wouldn’t stand a chance with this weather but I’m afraid I’m torturing him by keeping him inside for so long.

6,1669606074,self.CatAdvice,True,"TL;DR: My nervous cat seems to be scared of me and hates me now because of the medicine I've been feeding her. Looking for insights as to how long it'll take for her to forgive me and perhaps some advice about how to give her medication so that it isn't as stressful for both of us. 

Some quick backstory: I adopted my three-year-old cat a little over a year ago, and it was a challenge at first. She was super shy and refused to go out of hiding for two months. I spent a lot of time and energy building up trust and now she's the most loving and annoying little cat ever. Fast forward to this past week, which has been a hectic one. I moved her back from my parents' house two weekends ago, where she had been staying for roughly six weeks while I was in and out of the city for work. Everything seemed okay, until I noticed her scooting twice and licking her butt and tail a lot, so I took her to the vet this past weekend. Since she absolutely loathes her carrier, these two experiences were not great for her.

The vet gave me some cream to rub on her butthole and some liquid Clavamox. Giving her the medication has proven to be a huge challenge, to the point where I can only really give her both medications once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed. She hides under the couch (and sometimes in the couch), refuses to eat even when there's no medicine mixed with her wet food or treats (thankfully still eating dry food), and is so much more stressed and nervous around me. She's only approached me twice today, and it's only the second day of having to give her medicine.

Normally, my cat forgives me for taking her to the vet or moving her around relatively quickly, usually within a few hours. The fact that she seems so scared of me now and is avoiding me breaks my heart, and it seems that all the work I put into getting her to trust me has been completely undone. I don't even know how I'll be able to continue for the rest of the week, which is the length of time the medicine has been prescribed for.

On the bright side, I suppose, I didn't notice her scooting at all the day before I took her to the vet and she was acting normally, and ever since the vet visit, she hasn't scooted, but I think that's because she's pretty much been in hiding since then.",0,How long does it take a cat to forgive?

We’ll be gone for about a week and I’m dreading leaving my babies. I couldn’t imagine spending a whole week without them- much less them without me!!

10,1669595986,self.CatAdvice,True,"I've been taking care of a young stray?/feral? cat for nearly 2 months, including one weekend when he got into my apartment and refused to leave for a while. After he finally went back out but tried to get back in again, I was hoping to adopt him but my landlord has said I can't have a pet indoors, then conceded that I could keep feeding it outside.  I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. 

I've got the cat booked for neutering soon, but no shelters will take him due to a combination of overcrowding and his lack of socialization. No vets will even look at him beyond neutering him (which sucks because he's got a weird spot that I want checked out, but that's a whole other problem). None of my friends who foster unsocialized cats can take him yet. I was advised by someone at one of the really good shelters nearby to keep working with him outside in hopes of getting him into adoptable condition by the time they have an opening for him. So the poor little guy is kind of stuck in this situation for now. 

Even though the landlord said I could keep an outdoor cat, recent changes he (the landlord) has made to the property have made the cat prefer to spend most of its time on the new neighbors' property. The landlord installed a panel over the crawlspace under our porch and we found fur stuck to it, suggesting that the cat had tried to squeeze through the panel. We built the cat an outdoor shelter, but it turns out the neighbors have a hole under their porch so the cat prefers it to the shelter. *Sometimes* the neighbors put food near the hole, so they know about him but I don't think they're friends with him the way I am. He also tears open their trash bags to forage through them and leaves a huge mess on their walkway, and he uses some old rubbish on that property as his personal gym. We had bushes that birds hung out in that the cat used to like to watch, but now the landlord has cut them down. The landlord has also put up a giant fence around half the property. 

The cat comes to me when called, usually crossing the neighbors' yard to do so, but now that it's cold, he doesn't want to hang out as much and goes back to the neighbors' house after his meals. I give him a pretty regular food supply, I've put catnip on his stuff here, and I got him one of those little microwavable cat shelter heaters, but after a few minutes he still prefers the safety and spaciousness of being under their porch. He used to show signs of feeling safe with me on our porch, but lately he has  become very jumpy and his socialization progress has regressed a little. 

I'm really worried that the new neighbors are going to get fed up with him. But since my landlord is adamant that the cat cannot be inside and since the cat can't access our crawlspace anymore, I don't know what to do to get him to stay on this property. 

Anyone have any ideas of how to encourage him to stay on this property, or is that fool's errand with strays in winter?",0,Discouraging stray cat from bothering the neighbors,text,567,"['discouraging', 'stray', 'cat', 'bothering', 'neighbor', 'ive', 'taking', 'care', 'young', 'strayferal', 'cat', 'nearly', '2', 'month', 'including', 'one', 'weekend', 'got', 'apartment', 'refused', 'leave', 'finally', 'went', 'back', 'tried', 'get', 'back', 'hoping', 'adopt', 'landlord', 'said', 'cant', 'pet', 'indoors', 'conceded', 'could', 'keep', 'feeding', 'outside', 'im', 'still', 'pretty', 'heartbroken', 'ive', 'got', 'cat', 'booked', 'neutering', 'soon', 'shelter', 'take', 'due', 'combination', 'overcrowding', 'lack', 'socialization', 'vet', 'even', 'look', 'beyond', 'neutering', 'suck', 'he', 'got', 'weird', 'spot', 'want', 'checked', 'thats', 'whole', 'problem', 'none', 'friend', 'foster', 'unsocialized', 'cat', 'take', 'yet', 'advised', 'someone', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'shelter', 'nearby', 'keep', 'working', 'outside', 'hope', 'getting', 'adoptable', 'condition', 'time', 'opening', 'poor', 'little', 'guy', 'kind', 'stuck', 'situation', 'even', 'though', 'landlord', 'said', 'could', 'keep', 'outdoor', 'cat', 'recent', 'change', 'landlord', 'made', 'property', 'made', 'cat', 'prefer', 'spend', 'time', 'new', 'neighbor', 'property', 'landlord', 'installed', 'panel', 'crawlspace', 'porch', 'found', 'fur', 'stuck', 'suggesting', 'cat', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'panel', 'built', 'cat', 'outdoor', 'shelter', 'turn', 'neighbor', 'hole', 'porch', 'cat', 'prefers', 'shelter', 'sometimes', 'neighbor', 'put', 'food', 'near', 'hole', 'know', 'dont', 'think', 'theyre', 'friend', 'way', 'also', 'tear', 'open', 'trash', 'bag', 'forage', 'leaf', 'huge', 'mess', 'walkway', 'us', 'old', 'rubbish', 'property', 'personal', 'gym', 'bush', 'bird', 'hung', 'cat', 'used', 'like', 'watch', 'landlord', 'cut', 'landlord', 'also', 'put', 'giant', 'fence', 'around', 'half', 'property', 'cat', 'come', 'called', 'usually', 'crossing', 'neighbor', 'yard', 'cold', 'doesnt', 'want', 'hang', 'much', 'go', 'back', 'neighbor', 'house', 'meal', 'give', 'pretty', 'regular', 'food', 'supply', 'ive', 'put', 'catnip', 'stuff', 'got', 'one', 'little', 'microwavable', 'cat', 'shelter', 'heater', 'minute', 'still', 'prefers', 'safety', 'spaciousness', 'porch', 'used', 'show', 'sign', 'feeling', 'safe', 'porch', 'lately', 'become', 'jumpy', 'socialization', 'progress', 'regressed', 'little', 'im', 'really', 'worried', 'new', 'neighbor', 'going', 'get', 'fed', 'since', 'landlord', 'adamant', 'cat', 'cannot', 'inside', 'since', 'cat', 'cant', 'access', 'crawlspace', 'anymore', 'dont', 'know', 'get', 'stay', 'property', 'anyone', 'idea', 'encourage', 'stay', 'property', 'fool', 'errand', 'stray', 'winter']",discouraging stray bothering neighbor ive taking care young strayferal nearly  month including one weekend got apartment refused leave finally went back tried get back hoping adopt landlord said cant pet indoors conceded could keep feeding outside im still pretty heartbroken ive got booked neutering soon shelter take due combination overcrowding lack socialization vet even look beyond neutering suck he got weird spot want checked thats whole problem none friend foster unsocialized take yet advised someone one really good shelter nearby keep working outside hope getting adoptable condition time opening poor little guy kind stuck situation even though landlord said could keep outdoor recent change landlord made property made prefer spend time new neighbor property landlord installed panel crawlspace porch found fur stuck suggesting tried squeeze panel built outdoor shelter turn neighbor hole porch prefers shelter sometimes neighbor put food near hole know dont think theyre friend way also tear open trash bag forage leaf huge mess walkway us old rubbish property personal gym bush bird hung used like watch landlord cut landlord also put giant fence around half property come called usually crossing neighbor yard cold doesnt want hang much go back neighbor house meal give pretty regular food supply ive put catnip stuff got one little microwavable shelter heater minute still prefers safety spaciousness porch used show sign feeling safe porch lately become jumpy socialization progress regressed little im really worried new neighbor going get fed since landlord adamant cannot inside since cant access crawlspace anymore dont know get stay property anyone idea encourage stay property fool errand stray winter

For two years now. She is gentle (I’m a stay at home mom and I monitor their interactions, and taught her to pet and not grab his tail or hit). 

He has scratched her eye twice just by her bending down. He has clawed her legs when she walks by, drawing blood. We cannot keep them separated, as we live in a single family home. Our other cat runs away from her (she is old and skittish). Yui attacks. He has even attacked us, because he wants outside. In city limits, we can’t keep him outside.

We have tried keeping them separated, spraying with water, giving him alone time and more cuddles. Nothing is working, and our second baby will be here in early June. This is NOT a case of rehoming home because we are having another. This is, he is stressed, and these scratches (especially near the eye) can be dangerous. 

People think I haven’t tried every other options. I’ve exhausted them all. I’m gutted. He’s going to miss us, my daughter is going to wonder where he went. I’ve been crying all day. I don’t know if he’ll get as much love and treats. I just need to do what’s best for Yui and our kiddos.

24,1669582587,self.CatAdvice,True,"I rescued a young cat back in late October, and they still don't accept being touched. They take food from me as long as it's not directly from my hand (I can place it on the floor or near them, for example) and use all of the amenities provided (food, water, beds, litter) just fine, I can even sit close while they eat and we exchange slow blinks on occasion, but if I reach out with my hand they shy away from it. Which is fine, this was a completely feral cat that may or may not have seen the less kind side of humans while on the streets. 

Now, onto the question at hand: I've been keeping them in a very isolated room, and I only visit for a few minutes 3 times a day. My longest visit is about half an hour long, for dinner time.

38,1669554923,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 4 month old kitten yesterday, It was a hard decision but I thought it would help with my depression - and also because I miss my cat and rabbit from my parent’s home.
I brought him home by train and metro.
He was very quiet for 30 minutes and the next half hour he started meowing on the train. Tears came to my eyes, he was staring at me with his beautiful big eyes while meowing. He will miss his family (and his brother).

Once at home I locked myself in the bathroom with him, I put a pillow under the radiator, and gave him something to eat and drink. I spent two hours sitting on the floor with him, petting him, letting him explore and watching him sleep. Then I let him discover the kitchen and the main room.
He ended up eating, drinking and doing his business in his litter box. When I went to bed he came to snuggle with me, then he stuck to my face. I turned my back and he went to sleep on the sofa.

Everything is going well, only I feel bad. I have no appetite, my nose and throat are a little blocked (I had a cat and a rabbit at my parents' house for 18 years and never had any allergies). I am sensitive to the smell of cat drool when he plays, try to lick my nose. And also he leaves small deposits of fecal matter where he sits (sofa, cat tree, my sheets) probably microscopic but I can smell it. This kitten is clean though.

So here I am with all these feelings. 

He seems quite happy in my apartment, he purrs a lot and asks to play and cuddle. 
I'm afraid to leave him alone during the day for 9 hours, I'm afraid he'll do something bad / get bored.
For the moment I have only one toy, a thing with feathers, but I am afraid that he will ingest it by chewing on it.

I don’t feel like he should sleep in the corridor and not in the main room with me because it would be lonely somehow. But I dont want him IN my bed nor pillow.

The problem is, my cat has been sitting in front of the door all night waiting for me to come home 🥲 She hasn't moved at all.

I used the audio on the camera once to tell her it's ok, but she just looked around confused and it was so heartbreaking I didn't do it again 🥲🥲🥲 Help!

At the same day my cat got home, a family member brought in a stray kitten. 

2 days ago, i started to introduce my cat to the kitten. They look like they’re fine together so i let them be together without my watch (I’m sorry). I always leave dry food in the bowl so if they’re hungry, they can just eat. My cat seems weary (?) of the kitten so I’m not sure if he’s eating. 
Later that night, my cat started to sneeze from time to time. 

Yesterday, i let him hang out with the kitten downstairs again. I’m not sure if he’s eating the dry food (I’m sorry again). But he refused to eat the wet food. And his poop is watery.

Today, he looks like he wants to eat but didn’t eat. And his poop is watery too. He looks really tired too.

T had always been the only cat. After months of slowly introducing them to each other following the standard procedure. They were kind of getting along until one day they had a fight and over the next week T wasn't eating when he came in. Over the next few weeks he stopped coming in  to eat and coming back at all, maybe 1 night a week. It was obvious someone was feeding him. Now 8 weeks later, I've had to work extra hours with the weather getting worse I know T would be sleeping all day. But now I know which neighbour has been looking after him I don't know what to do.

Do I ask them to just stop feeding or stop feeding and not let him in (I know that would upset him as he doesn't want to come home at the minute anyway) while I try to reintroduce the cats? Or should I get him in and keep him locked in for a week (I have a week off before xmas)  and try to get them comfortable with each other again?

47,1669527994,self.CatAdvice,True,"
We have an 8 year old female cat we adopted over a year ago.
The resident cat’s background/personality:
She was sent to the rescue after her last owner passed. Due to her previous experience with multiple owners and fosters, it takes her a while to warm up to people and she gets scared easily. But once she trusts a person, she turns into such a lovely cat.

And then there is a 1 year old female cat we recently adopted. 
The new cat’s background/personality:
She was a stray cat and was rescued with her little kittens 2-3 months before we adopted her.
She loves attention and food. She constantly purrs, meows, kneads and rubs her face against anyone’s hand. She seemed to be okay around other cats when we went to the rescue centre to see her.


It has been 6 weeks since we brought the new cat home, and they HATE each other.
Here is what’s been going on. (Sorry this is a lot of details)

- When we brought the new cat home, we had our office room ready for her with a litter box, food bowl, cat bed, cat tree, etc. We didn’t let them see each other but let them smell each other through the door. We fed them together (with the door closed) so they can associate food to each other’s smell. The resident cat was quite anxious and hissing a lot. She wasn’t even comfortable passing that door. But over time, she has gotten better and now she can tolerate eating 2 feet away from the door. (But she still hisses and runs off after finishing her food.)

- We have been keeping the new cat in the office room, and the resident cat in the bedroom. They take turns to explore around the house throughout the day. We usually sleep with the resident cat, but I have been sleeping with the new cat in the office room because she meows so much.


- On our week 2, they ran into each other. (My partner just open the office room to see the new cat, and she just ran downstairs to the kitchen) There was no hissing or any interactions other than eye-contact. (But there was a bit of screaming from their humans…)

- On our week 3,  they ran into each other again. (My partner just opened the bedroom door without knowing the new cat was right behind him) And the new cat just straight up attacked the resident cat who was sleeping next to me. The resident cat was absolutely terrified. There was chunks of hair in the new cat’s paws :(

- We let them see each other through a babygate. My partner was on the resident cat’s side and I was on the new cat’s side. The resident cat was 10 feet away from the babygate, hiding under a chair. After a few stares, the new cat attempted to climb the babygate. There were some hissing and howling. We ended the session after that.

- We also got a huge playpen(tent) and installed it in the living room. At first we tried keeping the new cat in the tent all day and let the resident cat approach her when she feels comfortable. For the first 2 days, the resident cat didn’t even come downstairs. On the third day, she came downstairs but when she came closer to the tent, the new cat tried to attack her.


And now we are on week 7. We’ve watched a lot of youtube videos and read many articles, tried calming treats and all different types of Feliway plugins as well. I am so lost and beginning to wonder if it’s time for me to give up. I feel like I’m just torturing the cats and ourselves.

I have many friends who have cats but never heard of any failure stories… Do people often give up on cat introductions? If I continue this, would they eventually get along?

55,1669507896,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey guys! 
I need some advice &amp; was hoping to maybe get some feedback before Monday for the sake of my nerves. 

I have a 9 year old cat (Baylor) &amp; he recently came down with a super nasty cough, so I took him to the vet. It was an absolute nightmare &amp; he screamed/relieved himself the entire time he was in the back getting treated. I think (no, I know) he traumatized a beagle named Ralphie as well as 2 other cats &amp; a rabbit. The pigeons resting on the power lines outside probably sought out therapy because of what they heard. It was awful… anyways… 
He was also due for his yearly vaccines, so the vet decided to administer his antibiotics/steroids/vaccines all at once. The alternative was to put him through a 2nd trip &amp; sedate him, but he thought that would be more traumatic than just doing it all at once, so that’s what we did. That’s been 10 days ago exactly, &amp; his vet said the antibiotics would stay in his system for 2 weeks (if that’s relevant). 

Post-vet trip, he definitely didn’t feel well, but that was expected &amp; within 2 days his cough was gone &amp; he’d perked back up. While he was still recovering though, he stayed pretty much under our bed the entire time with the exception to eat &amp; potty. It’s worth noting (I think) that we recently moved in July &amp; our bedroom has carpet, which is something he’s never laid on before. I only mention that because I feel like it’s possible that the reason he is still staying under the bed is because it’s a new hiding spot he discovered that made him feel “safe” while he was feeling sick and plus it’s warm (I’m in KY so winter is settling in). 

But that’s what I need advice on - he’s still under the bed &amp; comes out pretty much never. For a few days he was out &amp; about more often than he is now. Idk. 
He’ll come downstairs &amp; meow for treats, but right back upstairs he goes straight under the bed. 
I have noticed that while he’s still using the litter box, there are a couple drops of pee (likes he’s dribbled) outside the box; however, we have another cat &amp; he’s a hot mess - he’s the messiest litter box user in all the land, so idk that it isn’t him. 

Anyways, he acts 100% normal, he looks normal in the eyes, when I check on him he’s responsive &amp; seems coherent, he just seems to have no desire to leave his little nest under the bed. 
Which, I have no issues with him being under there, so long as he’s okay. 

I’m calling his vet Monday, but was hopeful for some feedback before then. 
I hate to put him back through it because he’ll have to be sedated before they’ll work with him, especially if it’s unnecessary. Jeeze. 

Anyways - thank you for your feedback!

70,1669494206,self.CatAdvice,True,"Okay for context both my cats are two years old. I had them since kittens and i used to feed them 3 times a day. 6am then 2pm and then 930pm.

 As they got older i switched it to twice a day
630am and 930pm. Both adjusted quick but one cat my calico took a little longer to get used to the new schedule but it was no longer than a few days extra than my other cat. 

Now i feed them once a day at night 930pm but i feed them the same amount of food as i always have but just all at night. They have no problems eating, no vomit, and they are very active after eating which is fine. 

But my concern and i guess annoyance is my calico again is having trouble adjusting. She bothers all day meowing at me for food. Every morning she still thinks shes getting fed and throws a fit. By a fit i just mean meowing at me constantly as i get ready for work at 5am. Its been nearly two weeks now and she hasn’t adjusted to her new feeding schedule. My other cat has and she has no problem. Again i feed them the same amount of food just all at night. Its wet canned food.

75,1669474544,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two cats with extremely different eating habits and I'm not sure how to make sure one of them is eating a healthy amount. I've had one of the cats for almost eight years now (he'll be 8 in a couple months) and he's always been a grazer. He'll eat just a little bit at a time and likes having food in his bowl all day. Several months ago we got a new kitten, he's 11 months old now and is a little food crazy. If food is left out he'll eat it all. This has led to him eating too much food, and my older cat not getting enough and losing some weight. 

I tried giving the older cat wet food at night (along with the dry food during the day) but he rarely eats it all. I've tried ~10 different wet foods and there's only been one kind that he'd eat a whole can of (smaller cans not big ones) but that only lasted about a week before he didn't want it anymore. 

I'm trying to feed them in separate rooms, but my older cat just barely eats any food! I worry I won't be able to break his habit of wanting to eat little bits at a time.

I'm looking for advice on any other ways I could help my cat eat more in one sitting, or some foods with higher protein/calories that could be better for him to eat if he's going to eat such a small amount at a time.

My cat was a stray. I adopted her a year ago. We lived in a cottage with plenty of enclosed lawn area where dogs didn't get in. She does roam outside the area. 

We are considering moving to a new place. There are 3 bedroom (2 washroom) and it's on the ground floor. There are other building around too. And the main problem is that there person next door has an agressive dog. I don't think they let him out. But we are not sure of that. Plus there are community strays around the area. 

Is it a good idea to move in and keep her as a fully indoor cat? 

Best case scenario would be that they neighbor will keep their dog inside so she can roam around. But I think its most likely that we should keep her as a completely indoor cat.

84,1669450249,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi y'all! Adopted two fluffy Siamese mix sisters in June, everything pretty smooth except we're struggling to provide enough play for one of them. Wisp is a very active kitty who loves hunting and fighting and biting, she definitely has her snuggly moments and loves us and her sister but has sooo much energy. It's proving difficult to keep her focused on toys for longer periods of time, once she gets bored of playing with a toy and we stop, she immediately starts to attack stuff in the house. 

The blinds are a big issue accelerating our need for toys because she is systemically destroying them. Every window blind has pieces missing and we're increasingly afraid that our landlord will take notice of it if she continues. Keeping them rolled up isn't feasible as we're visible for anyone coming in the apartment building due to our apt placement. Curtains are against the lease terms unfortunately too.

Getting her redirected to toys is just getting harder with time. If anyone can suggest toys that might scratch this itch for her please let me know!! Anything work for your cats? Got any ideas that might fit what she needs? I'm running low on ideas. Details on what we've learned so far:

What she seems to enjoy is being able to reach/jump up and hunt things above her. The blinds are heavenly, she also climbed and ripped apart a small potted tree. Climbing it and hunting the leaves as they shook in response to her climbing was irresistible. She got bored when the leaves were all ripped off and the thin trunk was bent sideways so climbing wasn't very good.

I have a tall tower scratcher, medium height cat tree with 3 tallish levels, and a dangling bungee toy attached to a doorway arch. They just can't compete with the sweet sweet blinds. Other toys she likes but can't focus on anymore are the little plastic springs to hunt, and feather/ribbon bird on a wand. If these fail to work for short play sessions I don't know what we'll do to entertain her anymore haha.",0,"Suggestions for kitten toys? ~6 mo twins, active kitten loves shredding blinds and is causing lots of damage!",text,367,"['suggestion', 'kitten', 'toy', '6', 'mo', 'twin', 'active', 'kitten', 'love', 'shredding', 'blind', 'causing', 'lot', 'damage', 'hi', 'yall', 'adopted', 'two', 'fluffy', 'siamese', 'mix', 'sister', 'june', 'everything', 'pretty', 'smooth', 'except', 'struggling', 'provide', 'enough', 'play', 'one', 'wisp', 'active', 'kitty', 'love', 'hunting', 'fighting', 'biting', 'definitely', 'snuggly', 'moment', 'love', 'u', 'sister', 'sooo', 'much', 'energy', 'proving', 'difficult', 'keep', 'focused', 'toy', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'playing', 'toy', 'stop', 'immediately', 'start', 'attack', 'stuff', 'house', 'blind', 'big', 'issue', 'accelerating', 'need', 'toy', 'systemically', 'destroying', 'every', 'window', 'blind', 'piece', 'missing', 'increasingly', 'afraid', 'landlord', 'take', 'notice', 'continues', 'keeping', 'rolled', 'isnt', 'feasible', 'visible', 'anyone', 'coming', 'apartment', 'building', 'due', 'apt', 'placement', 'curtain', 'lease', 'term', 'unfortunately', 'toogetting', 'redirected', 'toy', 'getting', 'harder', 'time', 'anyone', 'suggest', 'toy', 'might', 'scratch', 'itch', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'anything', 'work', 'cat', 'got', 'idea', 'might', 'fit', 'need', 'im', 'running', 'low', 'idea', 'detail', 'weve', 'learned', 'farwhat', 'seems', 'enjoy', 'able', 'reachjump', 'hunt', 'thing', 'blind', 'heavenly', 'also', 'climbed', 'ripped', 'apart', 'small', 'potted', 'tree', 'climbing', 'hunting', 'leaf', 'shook', 'response', 'climbing', 'irresistible', 'got', 'bored', 'leaf', 'ripped', 'thin', 'trunk', 'bent', 'sideways', 'climbing', 'wasnt', 'goodi', 'tall', 'tower', 'scratcher', 'medium', 'height', 'cat', 'tree', '3', 'tallish', 'level', 'dangling', 'bungee', 'toy', 'attached', 'doorway', 'arch', 'cant', 'compete', 'sweet', 'sweet', 'blind', 'toy', 'like', 'cant', 'focus', 'anymore', 'little', 'plastic', 'spring', 'hunt', 'featherribbon', 'bird', 'wand', 'fail', 'work', 'short', 'play', 'session', 'dont', 'know', 'well', 'entertain', 'anymore', 'haha']",suggestion kitten toy  mo twin active kitten love shredding blind causing lot damage hi yall adopted two fluffy siamese mix sister june everything pretty smooth except struggling provide enough play one wisp active kitty love hunting fighting biting definitely snuggly moment love u sister sooo much energy proving difficult keep focused toy longer period time get bored playing toy stop immediately start attack stuff house blind big issue accelerating need toy systemically destroying every window blind piece missing increasingly afraid landlord take notice continues keeping rolled isnt feasible visible anyone coming apartment building due apt placement curtain lease term unfortunately toogetting redirected toy getting harder time anyone suggest toy might scratch itch please let know anything work got idea might fit need im running low idea detail weve learned farwhat seems enjoy able reachjump hunt thing blind heavenly also climbed ripped apart small potted tree climbing hunting leaf shook response climbing irresistible got bored leaf ripped thin trunk bent sideways climbing wasnt goodi tall tower scratcher medium height tree  tallish level dangling bungee toy attached doorway arch cant compete sweet sweet blind toy like cant focus anymore little plastic spring hunt featherribbon bird wand fail work short play session dont know well entertain anymore haha
85,1669447779,self.CatAdvice,True,"Alright, well like the title says, my 4 y/o cat has developed a habit of sticking/dipping/spooning out her food with her paws. 

She’s always been a bit quirky, and I discovered quickly after I adopted her at 3 months, that if I gave her wet food without mashing it up completely with water into a thinner paste/soup, that she would just grab chunks and pull them on the floor. She also ate her dry food so fast that I had to buy her a slow feeder.

She’s done well with adjustments I made according to her weird habits  and I haven’t really had issues until a few months ago when I noticed she was using her paws to scoop out her wet food and either lick it off her paws, or eat it off the ground.

I thought maybe the dish we had was too deep and narrow and it was hurting her whiskers to use that bowl, so I bought bowls that are flat and wide. Unfortunately it hasn’t helped and I’m running out of ideas. I’ve even put down a mat to help curb messes.

I’m now thinking that maybe I should get an elevated pet bowl to see if it’s more to do with the discomfort of eating from a bowl on the floor.

I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this sort of problem before and what things were tried and what worked.

I’m just worried because she’ll jump straight from her litter and then use her paws to eat. I can’t imagine that’s good for her :( not to mention I obviously don’t want my cat eating straight off the floor. Sometimes I step in food without realizing and she’ll just eat that too. Or she’ll eat random hair and then have hairball issues that she’s already prone to.

One other weird food bowl issue I’ve also noticed recently is that she sometimes gets in this obsessive mindset of trying to bury her food. Of course she cannot dig into my floor, she she ends up scratching around her bowl until sometimes she tips it over. I have her food dish as far from her litterbox as I can have it, because I’ve read that sometimes cat’s will want to bury their scent and of course a kill/eating area is something cats would want to coverup from predators or other cats.

I know it’s a lot of info, but I’m hoping someone will have gone through something similar and can give me ideas that I haven’t tried.",0,Advice on my cat using her paws to eat wet food,text,427,"['advice', 'cat', 'using', 'paw', 'eat', 'wet', 'food', 'alright', 'well', 'like', 'title', 'say', '4', 'yo', 'cat', 'developed', 'habit', 'stickingdippingspooning', 'food', 'paw', 'always', 'bit', 'quirky', 'discovered', 'quickly', 'adopted', '3', 'month', 'gave', 'wet', 'food', 'without', 'mashing', 'completely', 'water', 'thinner', 'pastesoup', 'would', 'grab', 'chunk', 'pull', 'floor', 'also', 'ate', 'dry', 'food', 'fast', 'buy', 'slow', 'feedershe', 'done', 'well', 'adjustment', 'made', 'according', 'weird', 'habit', 'really', 'issue', 'month', 'ago', 'noticed', 'using', 'paw', 'scoop', 'wet', 'food', 'either', 'lick', 'paw', 'eat', 'groundi', 'thought', 'maybe', 'dish', 'deep', 'narrow', 'hurting', 'whisker', 'use', 'bowl', 'bought', 'bowl', 'flat', 'wide', 'unfortunately', 'helped', 'running', 'idea', 'even', 'put', 'mat', 'help', 'curb', 'messesi', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'get', 'elevated', 'pet', 'bowl', 'see', 'discomfort', 'eating', 'bowl', 'floori', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'else', 'dealt', 'sort', 'problem', 'thing', 'tried', 'workedi', 'worried', 'jump', 'straight', 'litter', 'use', 'paw', 'eat', 'imagine', 'good', 'mention', 'obviously', 'want', 'cat', 'eating', 'straight', 'floor', 'sometimes', 'step', 'food', 'without', 'realizing', 'eat', 'eat', 'random', 'hair', 'hairball', 'issue', 'already', 'prone', 'toone', 'weird', 'food', 'bowl', 'issue', 'also', 'noticed', 'recently', 'sometimes', 'get', 'obsessive', 'mindset', 'trying', 'bury', 'food', 'course', 'cannot', 'dig', 'floor', 'end', 'scratching', 'around', 'bowl', 'sometimes', 'tip', 'food', 'dish', 'far', 'litterbox', 'read', 'sometimes', 'cat', 'want', 'bury', 'scent', 'course', 'killeating', 'area', 'something', 'cat', 'would', 'want', 'coverup', 'predator', 'catsi', 'know', 'lot', 'info', 'hoping', 'someone', 'gone', 'something', 'similar', 'give', 'idea', 'tried']",using paw eat wet food alright well like title say  yo developed habit stickingdippingspooning food paw always bit quirky discovered quickly adopted  month gave wet food without mashing completely water thinner pastesoup would grab chunk pull floor also ate dry food fast buy slow feedershe done well adjustment made according weird habit really issue month ago noticed using paw scoop wet food either lick paw eat groundi thought maybe dish deep narrow hurting whisker use bowl bought bowl flat wide unfortunately helped running idea even put mat help curb messesi thinking maybe get elevated pet bowl see discomfort eating bowl floori wondering anyone else dealt sort problem thing tried workedi worried jump straight litter use paw eat imagine good mention obviously want eating straight floor sometimes step food without realizing eat eat random hair hairball issue already prone toone weird food bowl issue also noticed recently sometimes get obsessive mindset trying bury food course cannot dig floor end scratching around bowl sometimes tip food dish far litterbox read sometimes want bury scent course killeating area something would want coverup predator catsi know lot info hoping someone gone something similar give idea tried
86,1669443057,self.CatAdvice,True,"When I first got my cat, a year and half ago, I made a critical mistake: I gave her kibble each morning, when I woke up.
After a few months, when I noticed she was waking me up to demand her food, I stopped doing that, and gave her food each evening instead. 

The problem is, she never unlearned this habit, and since then wake me up nearly each morning at 4-6 am. 
She is very demanding, purring, licking, climbing me, and above all, the dreadfully ""paw in the eye"" maneuver!
She is relentless, until I'm up and about, then she will go eat without further problem and let me go back to sleep (if I manage to...)

Some details:

She have a tower feeder.  Each evening I put enough kibble for 24h. So she have far enough kibble in the tower for her morning meal. 

She know how to feed herself from the tower, and doesn't need me. She just wait until I'm up and in the same room as the feeder to do it... I don't even have to approach the feeder, just being in the same room... 

To be more precise, there is a stair leading to the main room. 
If I am on the last step of the stair, she will wait, keep peace between the feeder and me, prodding me to continue. 
If I make one more step to be in the room, she will be content and eat, I'm not needed anymore..

My apartment is really open, with no door that I could use to prevent her from sleeping with me and walking me up (and I like the fact that she sleep with me every night)

88,1669438672,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat (2.5y neutered female) I adopted as a sole kitten. I just very recently learned about single Kitten Syndrome and feel so guilty for adopting her alone and feel like her quality of life is so low because she doesn’t have a friend. My sister has two cats but we’ve tried for over a year to slowly socialize them together and it is absolutely not working. When they have accidentally gotten at each other with no cage, My cat will run after them and pounce on them when their social cues indicate they don’t want that. My sister is very well versed in cat care so we have been taking all the proper steps to try and socialize them slowly but she just won’t reduce her aggression. I think she’s trying to play but they perceive it as an attack - which it pretty much is. 

I really want to help her overcome this, as she’s going to be without me soon when I go off to college next summer. I want her to have someone else to play with besides my dad and sister because they are busy people. I also would like her to be able to move from my dads house with me eventually and I don’t feel comfortable with her being away from our remote area with no other outdoor cats. My ultimate goal is for her to be able to be more of an indoor cat (I’m aware of the ethical and environmental problems with indoor/outdoor cats which is why I want her to get more stimulation within the home so she doesn’t crave the outdoors so much). My question currently is: Would it be a good idea to get her her own kitten friend? The reason I think it might be better is because my sisters cats are heavily bonded and are already afraid of her. I don’t see them warming up to her anytime soon. I thought maybe it would be a good idea to teach her to socialize appropriately on her own new friend, maybe a kitten because she might be more gentle with it? I just want her to be happy without having to be outside most of the day, and I wish this wasn’t a problem I love her so much and want her to have cat friends to play with.

91,1669431932,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I need some advice regarding a sweet stray who decided that we will be his family and he basically let us know that we will be adopting him. 

We took him to the vet today for an exam &amp; vaccinations. We scheduled his neuter for December 12. The vet estimates that he’s around a year old.

He’s healthy overall but tested positive for roundworms- not surprising since he’s lived outdoors for most of his life. We have him quarantined in our climate controlled garage so he is warm and safe. My question is - how long until the worms are gone? I’m ready to bring him into live with us but we have 2 cats and we don’t want to spread worms. 

Thanks I’m advance! I forgot to ask the vet today. He had a meltdown as soon as we went toward the car. Once we got into the vet he peed and pooped in his carrier and was almost inconsolable. I can’t help but think he remembers being dumped on the side of the road.

92,1669431317,self.CatAdvice,True,"TL/DR: my cat is being extremely aggressive with me and I need tips to navigate it until the vet. 

I am prefacing this by making it clear she’s going to be checked out by the vet in a few days (which was the soonest they could fit her in) 

Background info: 
My cat has always been aggressive when I have visitors, but it’s been manageable. 

Recently she’s been aggressive with me - this has been only following a specific incident. 

I blew a hiking safety whistle in the kitchen (just not thinking) and it triggered an “episode” where she started yowling at me, pupils dilated, and aggressively following me as I backed away from her until I could cordon her into a part of the house to calm down. (I had some gabepenton gave to her in food to help the calm) 

Since then there’s been multiple occasions where she though I was going to do that loud noise thing in the kitchen, and has began to do the same behaviours. 

The last two days in particular have been hellish because she mistook my being at the bench in the kitchen as a possible re-do, I caught her eye and noticed her pupils dilating and beginning to take the strange body language she displayed that night, and has been aggressive ever since. 

I thought the night would “reset” her to calm mode, but this morning she was on edge and not really comfortable as I moved about my morning duties, tentative and anxious, sharply observing me - I fed her and played for a while with her toy but noticed whenever I caught her eye her focus would be primarily on me and not the toy and I sensed it wouldn’t take much at all to set her off again. Cut to me making a tea in the kitchen, and she was at my feet, when I looked down and at her, the pupils went big again and she began her tense body and meowing, and as soon as I back away she yowls louder and it’s happening once again. 

I feel so guilty because she’s spend most of the last 36 hours or so blocked off in a small part of the house. I’m giving her the gabepenten in food serves to try and calm some of this - but I just feel awful, it’s a silly mistake I made one time, thats turned into what appears to be a trauma for her - as she already had a nervous disposition. Now our relationship has been severely impacted, the trust seems gone. I always appreciated that she was a cranky little defensive thing, but with me she was tolerant, and even sometimes, when I was lucky, loving and a lap cat etc. 

I’m terribly afraid of what’s going to happen at the vets - because the last few times I’ve brought her in, it’s basically been a costly bust, because they’re not willing to take her out of her cage (understandably) even with the gabepenton, so they’ve not been able to perform a full check. 

This time they say they’ll sedate her and check her ears because she’s been shaking her head frequently and seems bothered by her ears. (This also makes me feel awful because what if the whistle caused some damage!?) 

Anyways - now all the background has been provided - my question is - how do I make it through the next 3 days if her temperament remains on this level? Am I going to have to keep drugging her and sequestering her in small rooms until then, for my own safety? Isn’t that only going to cause her further trauma and distrust? 

Any tips on how to navigate such an aggressive frame of mind of hers until she can be seen to would be so very appreciated!

I have Gus and another boy, and they get along, they've started playing and everything, they also eat dinner side by side everyday. My roommate has two cats as well. 



Gus is a larger guy compared to two and the one he doesn't suddenly get along with (Soup) is definitely the biggest. Gus would still be on edge for a while while walking by Soup and would hiss and maybe swat if Soup got too close but that was it. 


Yesterday all of a sudden a cat fight broke out between the two while I was out of the house. My roommate described it to be pretty scary, and both of them were going toward one another... so we decided to keep Gus isolated in my room for the night, and just today I decided to let Gus out to see how it would go... and yes, the two went to fight again. I initially grabbed gus who was trying to get out of my arms and run away while Soup was climbing up me to attack. I then grabbed Soup who mauled up my arm while Gus ran away. 



I'm at a loss and I'm panicked. Rehoming isn't an option, and me and my roommate likely won't be living together much longer since I may be moving out of town.

I have my cat currently over at my house and just go over to spend time with the other cats and feed them, since I’m worried to freak my cat out by moving her over there.

I have seen kitten play dates are a bad idea on here, I’m worried about the potential of her getting used to the new house then after this month moving back here to our house where her space would be reduced to one floor instead of three.

The plot also gets even more complicated when one of the cats I’m taking care of over there is one my neighbor is contemplating rehoming to me when I move out within the next year. So that would mean my cat would have to get used to and test it out to see if she likes him. But I don’t know if I should stress her out for such a short term thing, and I don’t plan to as of now.

he’s gotten so comfortable with me and my bf in such a short amount of time; he is confidently roaming our apartment and is very playful. it only took about a week for him to be ready to leave his safe room. even so, he’s still very cautious of everything and everyone, and seems very antisocial. he’s still not fully comfortable around our flatmate yet and when we had 2 of our friends friends over last week, he hid in his tower for 6 hours straight and refused to come out until they left. this has me worried about how he will react to travelling and staying in another house for a few days. 

i live in London and my parents house is about an hour and a half train journey away which isn’t too bad but i know he’s going to be stressed regardless. i’m afraid that when we get there, he will hide under the sofa the entire time and refuse to eat or something like that. we plan on bringing his toys, cat tree and bed with us so hopefully he will feel more at home. is there any i can further prepare for to make this whole situation easier?

99,1669419183,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello all! Glad to be around fellow cat enthusiasts. 

I have a dilemma on a potential foster fail situation and I’d like to get some perspective. 


I’ve been fostering for about a year and a half and have fostered 20 cats. Very early in our foster days, my partner and I adopted a brother and sister from a litter we were fostering. We wanted to keep the girl immediately and we kept her brother because he was nervous and needed a pal. We love them unconditionally and have no regrets whatsoever. My partner and I acknowledge we were overzealous at the time and probably should’ve given them a chance to get adopted out. Fast forward, and we have significantly more fostering experience after 20 kittens. I love my fosters, but I’ve never been that attached to them and am happy when they find their homes. 

Until we got our current fosters last weekend, Truffles and Butterscotch, a bonded pair of calico sisters. My heart exploded the moment I let them out of their carrier. They’re 6 months old, my oldest fosters so far. They are so loving, polite, cuddly, get along with my cats, and well mannered girls. They wanted to sleep under the covers with us immediately and be carried around like babies. My partner and I are *so* torn on keeping them. We fully acknowledge 4 cats is a lot of work, cleaning, more vet bills and more commitment. But we adore them in a way I haven’t felt about any of my previous fosters, including my own cats.

107,1669406388,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone, I'm new here so sorry if I miss something!
My partner and I have two beautiful cats (7yo Persian/Ragdoll male and 3yo Persian female). We recently adopted a British Shorthair kitten (3.5 months-ish male) and he is very excited and active, as kittens are..

The 7yo is fine with him but sometimes loses his patience. The 3yo, however, is very stressed by the kitten. She hasn't been nice to him once. She hisses and growls at him if she sees him nearby and bats him if he dares to get too close. I know this stuff is normal, but he's been home over a month with no improvement.

This evening I was trying to remove some of her matted fur and she got very aggressive with me. She also seems to have some balding spots on the side of her belly (possibly over grooming, or maybe from matting?) she often gets matts but it's never been this alarming. She's also losing her voice from hissing so much.

We have feliway friends plugins but they don't seem to be helping. I absolutely adore my little Persian, she's always been feisty and a little distant, but now she seems VERY stressed and aggressive with everyone, not just the kitten.

The kitten has a special room he's been confined to since he came home so they have their own 'safe spaces' but I'm worried my little Persian is going to end up in a bad way from the stress.

111,1669400988,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two cats. They are littermates and I've had them for two years. Until four days ago they were good friends, always playing and caring for each other. They always slept together and never seemed to mind sharing their resources (we have plenty of food and water resources around the house and 3 litterboxes). They are both neutered. 

Four days ago they suddenly got into a nasty fight. They were both sleeping in our bed and out of the blue we started hearing yeowling and hissing. The smaller one hid and there were drops of urine and bits of fur on the floor. After this I separated them, and kept them in different rooms, each with water, food and litterboxes. 

One day later I tried to unite them again. They were fine for 20 minutes, and then started fighting again. 

Now I've been keeping them separated for 3 days. They are chill with me and my partner, they just dont like being stuck in rooms, without being able to roam around the house. One of the rooms has a glass door, so I can have them both looking at eachother without touching - however, I have been doing this for short periods of time since when they see eachother they freak out and stare, with raised hairs. Both seem agressive towards one another. 

Last time I did this (today), the smaller one hid, and has been hiding inside the glass door room ever since. 

I have bought a Feliway diffuser, but so far no results. They have been seen by a vet, that said it seemed a comportamental issue and suggested medicating one of them (the initial agressor).

112,1669398798,self.CatAdvice,True,"1st option: the house of the parents of my girlfriend. It's on the field, near a forest, so chances of escaping are high. She's climbed to trees before, but the parents of my girlfriend won't be able to climb after her. Also now there are 2 new dogs that she doesn't know. She will have the whole house for her and will be able to sleep wherever she wants.

2nd option: a room in the house of a friend. This friend has another cat and 2 dogs. Our cat has leucemia (no symptoms though), so she won't be able to mingle with the other cat, which is why she'd be in a room. We're not sure if the friend's cat has the vaccine for leucemia but we're offering to pay it, just in the event that she escapes that room (she will 100% escape at least twice). The good thing is that ""escaping"" here doesn't mean that she will be out in the forest.

3rd option: not a lot. Pet hotels are either too expensive or they keep the animals in cages, which would be worse than option 2.

113,1669397041,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello. My girlfriend and I recently (month ago) adopted two cats from the local shelter. One (7month male) and the other (2.5 yr female). Both fixed and such. 

Does anyone have any suggestions - I am feeling a bit like we made a mistake not getting either *just* the 2.5 yr old or not getting the 7mo along with another kitten from his litter. 

He is very active and curious. He wants to play anytime he isn’t sleeping. She enjoys laying low all day long and can sit in front of the window for hours on end. She isn’t really interested in play time (maybe about 10 min max (if that) a day). Obviously this isn’t the best mix. He walks around sadly meowing sometimes like he really wants a friend. I work from home so I can give him a bit of attention but I really feel like he needs a friend around his age with similar energy. 

We cannot get a third cat at our apartment (2 max). Also, we don’t know her history - the shelter didn’t have much info to share. (Don’t know if she was someone’s house pet that they gave up or what). He and his liter were found in a trash can and spent the first 6 months at the shelter. 

At first she was very scared of him. Hissing and running and hiding anytime he got near. (We had them meet at the shelter and that didn’t happen there). Over the course of the last month that has improved and it isn’t as often. However he tries to play with her and it truly seems like she just doesn’t understand what play is. We thought they were finally playing together the other day but once the wrestling stopped it was clear she did not know that it was play (she was extremely shaken and anxious for ~20 min after). 

I guess I’m not sure what to do. Perhaps she needs to be in a home where she is the only cat. She’s not very affectionate towards humans either. But I don’t know if that’s in part because the kitten is always around.

118,1669386767,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi There! 

So… Our cat likes to snack on our dog’s food. She is up 1 lb from last year, so I don’t want the trend to continue. I talked to her vet about it, and he said it’s not great for her because the nutritional balance is different. 

Our dog is a grazer, so it’s not ideal to put his food away — but that may ultimately be the easiest and best solution. 

In the meantime, I’ve been feeding our cat less of her food to hopefully balance it out. 

I even tried getting the same flavor and brand of the dog’s food in the cat version, but she wouldn’t touch it 😅

119,1669381419,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat loves to be outdoors and during the day gets to be wherever he wants because there is almost always someone to open the door for him. However this is a problem at night. At some point, he starts to complain to go out. After an hour or so he comes back. He usually repeats this 2-3 times until the morning. I’ve tried several times to spare other family members from waking up from his meows by trying to get him to sleep in my bedroom at least for a few hours, but he meows deeply and sadly pretty soon.

The solution for this in the warmer months is by leaving him in the nearby shed over the night where he has food/water and a litterbox inside. I pick him up in the morning. However the nights are much colder now, it can get around 32F (0C) outside, not much warmer in the shed. I feel like it’s not right to leave him there while it’s that cold, I feel guilty that he would be freezing and having health problems afterwards.

120,1669354660,self.CatAdvice,True,"I've posted here multiple times before but nothing seems to work, so I'm trying to get more opinions again. 

We got our cat in March from the local shelter; she was declawed and immediately surrendered by her previous owner and has some other trauma, as well as previously being indoor/outdoor. Ever since we got her she has always pooped outside of the litter box. She'll pee in it but is really inconsistent about pooping. 

She has two litter boxes in different parts of the house that are always accessible to her and they're scooped daily. I switch out the litter every 4-6 weeks. She has a soft litter (okocat) for her paws and I put Cat Attract in it when I swap out the boxes.

We've swapped out her food for one that suits her, gone through three or four litters, got a hood for both of her boxes, took off a hood, bought a new box, put it in another location, we encourage her and give her extra affection every time we see her use the litter box, and we move her into the litter box if she looks like she's about to go.

We took her to the vet months ago, but the vet told us that she was perfectly healthy, just having behavioral problems, but to keep trying new things. 

It's incredibly stressful and honestly embarrassing especially that it's gone on this long, and I absolutely would never rehome her unless I literally could not take care of her anymore financially and/or physically but I'm running out of solutions. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason-- she'll have a perfectly clean fresh litter box and then just walk in our room, poop by the XBox, twitch her tail a couple of times, and leave. No texture preference either-- brick, carpet, and our regular plastic flooring are all vulnerable to her ass. She's a very large cat, especially since she's not adult age yet, and she poops at least two or three times per day and her stool is huge.

124,1669348753,self.CatAdvice,True,"I’m here for advice because I want to help her! I don’t have much background on where she came from but I can say she likely was not socialized properly.

Miss Maisie is 4 months old and I can tell she wants to be loved ! She will play with her ribbon toy, she will eat food out of my hand. I’ve lured her up super close to my face to where she was standing on me with a treat. She is not afraid to be around generally. She comes in the couch if I’m sitting up there, she sleeps on the couch or in the cat tree. Sometimes in the kitchen she doesn’t even run if I walk past her. She even sleeps on my legs sometimes, or I’ll feel her walking up my back while I’m laying down “asleep”. She gets close and sniffs but quickly darts away. 

It’s like she just has really bad anxiety. I do handle her quite often and whenever I have people over they like to play with her. My boyfriend handles her as well. Sometimes I approach her on the cat tree and let her sniff me and give her a little pet. Sometimes she hisses but she’s not aggressive- she’s never bitten or scratched me. Her ears are never back either. The fact that she will eat from my hands - which I take advantage of- makes me believe she kinda trusts me at least a little? As bad as it is I give her whipped cream when I have it, in exchange I pet her while she eats it.

128,1669323690,self.CatAdvice,True,"Our two cats are 1,5y, f and m. My girl always voiced her disapproval by peeing, but very rarely (maybe 3 times since we got them a year ago) and it was always very clear what the reason was (she peed on clothes that smelled like a different cat that lay on the floor for some time for example). 

So roughly two weeks ago, she suddenly started peeing into the corridor and the bathroom in three different spots. We went to the vet, medically she is fine. I'm trying to figure out what the problem is, but I'm struggling here, so maybe someone has some ideas. 

So what I've already figured out/ruled out: 

Changes: My schedule changed and I'm home a bit less. My SO is home the same amount of time as before, and the cats schedule didn't change (same feeding and play times). Also, I disconnected their water fountain and switched it temporarily to a simple bowl (because the cats didn't use it and I was planning on trying a different one. Extra problem, the water pump started to be super loud and annoying after a year). But could that really be why she pees outside the box? Two to three times a day? And if so, what can I do to stop it?

What I'm already doing right: the two cats have three litter boxes that get cleaned two to three times a day. They don't have a lid or lining and are placed both in social and a bit more quiet areas throughout the house (living room, bathroom and by the entrance), also no litter changes. The pee spots get cleaned with enzyme cleaners every time after the cat pees there. We play with wand toys three times a day for ~15-20 mins each, we have regular feeding times. The cats have toys they can play play themselves, cat trees, window spots, and get lots of attention and love. There is no tension between the cats, they play with each other and all seems fine. We had a feliway diffuser before when we they came to us but stopped using it shortly after, we bought a new one two days ago, but it didn't change anything yet.

133,1669307944,self.CatAdvice,True,"I am aware cats are night creatures, however... my neighbors don't know. And also don't care. And thus it's for me to ""fix"" the problem before I get kicked out...

Short story long, I've adopted 2 kittens - they are 14 weeks old now. They are very kind, playful, and cute. They sleep the entire day but they have this thing where they get crazy active around 1-2 AM.

They look like ""posseted"" creatures. They hit everything, jump from all over the place and run like crazy. Initially I thought I can get them tired, but they can keep at it over 1 hour...  They mostly chase each other, but even if just one of them feels like this, he's doing it all by himself. And it's terrible for my neighbours.

Currently, what I do is when they get active, I close them in the smallest room - the bathroom. They miau for 5 minutes, hit the door... but eventually they go to sleep. However, I feel bad to do this.

I've tried feeding them earlier (last meal at 19-20). I tried feeding them late (last meal at 23). I tried playing with them for over 1h with all sorts of toys - around 9PM. It's great, at 10 they go to sleep, wake up an 2AM and go crazy again.

I tried keeping them awake during the day, but... I still have to work. Every time I stop giving them attention, they just go to sleep.   


Usually I try to hit the bed around 11 - where I stay 1h longer reading. Sometimes they come sleep with me, sometimes they don't...

Note: They also have a small window of crazy activity in the morning, around 8. But it ends after I feed them (usually at 8:30) - they just go to sleep after.

Is it bad to lock them out, every night, hoping they just go to sleep and in time adjust their schedule?

I went back to the shop, and well turns out, the shop does in fact state that they do mix the cat litter with bentonite clay. 89% is Tofu Cat Litter and 11% is Bentonite (or so the product says). I simply just didn't pay attention, since I was more focused on searching for the same brand I liked.

Inevitably if one comes back from the vet smelling a bit funny there is some hissing but they sleep together and play together and seem to genuinely love each other. 

In the past I’ve traveled with them to visit my parents in a different state. It’s a long drive but they don’t seem to mind it too much and on previous visits they were a bit stressed upon arrival to my parents house (they had 2 cats and 2 dogs) but after some time would venture out of my room and my parents pets would come into my room. They never liked my parents pets but they seemed to tolerate one another without too much fuss. 

This year my parents have moved to a smaller house and adopted a new and much bolder car than their other two.

147,1669264339,self.CatAdvice,True,"We have a 5 month old family cat that my brother brought home a month ago (funded by our parents and me), and so he refers to her as “his cat.” He accepted full responsibility beforehand since he really wanted a cat.

I have a problem with how he takes care of his cat. She gets food and water on somewhat of a schedule, and receives lots of cuddles (when she is open to receiving them). However, my brother never plays with “his cat” and she has destroyed a few household objects because of the lack of activity.

She also jumps and scratches and so if she isn’t distracted by play then she is with him in his room while he is on his laptop or phone. 

She meows and paws at the door a lot but he claims it’s just for “attention” and she doesn’t need nearly as much physical activity as I “think she does” even though I’ve done research and spoke with two animal behaviorists on this subject and he’s admitted to doing “no research,” but he still knows “better than” me.

The rest of the household plays with the cat when we can, but one member has an IDD and is scared of the cat because my brother doesn’t “believe in training” and won’t do anything for when she jumps on people except 1) tell the person she is jumping on that it’s not a big deal and 2) take her back to his room and do nothing to help her get her energy out.

153,1669248783,self.CatAdvice,True,"I recently adopted an 8 week old kitten (Susan) &amp; brought her home to my apartment. I currently live with my partner &amp; his 2 year old cat (Fork). I did my best to take things slow but my partner is a little less… cautious than I am, so they met fairly quickly and after a bit of hissing from Fork he quietened down. 

Now, my concern is this. Fork is a big cat and he’s not well socialised (in my opinion). He isn’t affectionate, rarely comes near us, is very shy in new situations, but is quite energetic. I do my best to play with him and provide him mental stimulation but he never tires. When he tries to “play” with the kitten he is quite rough and he also never leaves her alone. He follows her (and I) from room to room and completely fixated on her. When he approaches and tries to play/bop her, she doesn’t want to engage but he keeps going, chasing her around and getting rougher and rougher. 

Previously, my partner and Fork lived in a shared flat with an older cat who didn’t want anything to do with him but he would just follow her around and paw at her, never backing off even when she hissed at him. He wasn’t aggressive per se but it was almost like “how much can I annoy this other cat”.

I’m doing my best to reward Fork when he is gentle and “punish” him when he’s rough but separating them and closing the door, but I’m concerned he’s bullying her.

158,1669244589,self.CatAdvice,True,"I recently adopted a shelter cat (from a feral cat colony - he was injured and had his leg amputated, upon which he was sent to a shelter). He is about 4 years old, and a neutered male. 

When we met shelter cat and first brought him home, he was skittish but open to petting and really seemed to enjoy it. 

We currently have a 13 yr old domesticated neutered male who has been the only cat in his household. 

After introducing the two of them (slow intros, scent swapping, separate rooms, visual through gate), shelter cat started hissing at humans and now does not allow any human contact, swatting and biting us if we try. He has not really been improving, despite being extremely food motivated. He will eat near us, but runs away immediately after finishing his food/treats.

162,1669232896,self.CatAdvice,True,"To keep things short, around 2 weeks ago i came across a male cat who had puss in his eyes and wounds in his ear. It was freezing outside and he was soaking wet. I was actually going to the neighbours house (let’s call her Alison) and Alison told me that the owners leave this cat outside all the time. They don’t care for it and only use it for breeding to make money. She also told me that they have a female cat that they keep indoors but they’ve bred this cat around 7/8 times and the cat is 5 years old. My heart broke for them both and the male cat was so friendly, he kept trying to get inside my car and sit on my bonnet just for the engine warmth. Alison has rang the RSPCA and the local council multiple times but they haven’t done anything. I also rang RSPCA on the same day i saw him and i sent pictures of him to them and they still haven’t done anything yet. However, my problem is that it’s getting colder here in the UK and it’s only a matter of time before this poor cat dies from negelect. I personally don’t think anything’s going to be done about this so i’m seriously contemplating pulling up one day and just taking him. He needs serious vet attention and somewhere warm to recover. Alison told me that the cat isn’t microchipped or even flead and wormed, and the owners are very hostile so approaching them and asking them for the cat if they don’t want it is out of the question. 

Basically, I was wondering if I should actually take him? And what can i do to avoid getting caught? Because morally i just can’t leave that cat there to die.

165,1669225822,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi guys I was wondering if you could help.

If I ring the vet they'll most likely say bring my boy in but if I do that he gets very stressed and had cystitis in the past so I'm worried the stress will cause a flare up.

He is a 4 year old male on prescribed food for the previous issue of cystitis. He's a greedy boy too always face first in the bowl. He is a indoor cat so has not got hold of anything he shouldn't have.

He has had a upset tummy 3 days. First day he went and it was like soft serve and slightly yellow but not alarming. He then went twice more that evening and was pure liquid. 

Second day exactly the same as his first but this day he didn't eat all day. Also wasn't himself.

Ge started eating again yesterday smaller amounts but something. Yesterday it was just like soft serve and normal colour. 

Today he is eating a little still. Is much more himself, alert, playful, wants fuss. Even had 100 percent chicken breast treats. But he's been 3 times today. 2 times like soft serve but a little more put together. Then this evening so almost the 4th day now it was slightly yellow again, some formation but more liquid then earlier today. 

I'm not sure wether he's actually on the mend or I should take him up tomorrow. In himself he's doing better but the slightly worse last poo worries me.

Everytime he goes to the vet and for the whole journey he meows, shakes and pants. Then comes home and shakes for hours. 

Also money is a issue. I do have a little and I do have insurance but it's the kind you pay upfront and claim back. I can attach photos of poop but I'm not sure you'd want to see.

166,1669223902,self.CatAdvice,True,"TLDR: I took in a litter of 3 feral kittens, they’re 2 months old, 2 females, 1 male. I’ve been taking care of them with the hope of socializing them and giving them out for adoption. Their socialization process has been slow. I want to know when the right time to let them out into my bedroom is, their enclosure is in my bedroom. 

▪️(Female) Kitten 1 
Arrived October 25-
I started to let her out into the room 2 weeks ago but now I only let her out to sleep on the bed. When let out in my room, very playful and active on her own but gets scared easily and runs and hides when I walk into the room, when there’s sounds or sometimes if I move. Sometimes she’ll let me pet her but most of the time she won’t stay and will run off. Seems antsy to be loose in the room. Used to be cuddlier when she arrived. The one with the most progress, lets me pick her up most of the time when in the enclosure, sleeps on my bed but not very cuddly.  

▪️(Male) Kitten 2 
Arrived November 7- 
Has bitten me hard 3 times, they day he arrived and the day after a vet visit. This kitten has had the slowest progress of all three. He’ll stay on my lap to eat but will want off as soon as he’s done eating. I pet him when he eats. Usually doesn’t let me pet him when I reach in the enclosure. Does eat from my hand. Strong, if he runs I have to let him go, he’ll bite, wiggle and scratch otherwise. 

▪️(Female?) Kitten 3
Arrived November 15-I can pet her sometimes while she’s in the enclosure. Sometimes she watches me intently and up until recently, her eyes dilated most of the time I was near, not as much now, I look away. She’ll stay on my lap a little while after feeding and I’ll pet her. Will eat from my hand. 

➖They all seem to want to be out in the room and get really curious when kitten 1 is out but since I don’t know when the right time to introduce them to my bedroom is, I stopped letting Kitten 1 out.

We also moved about 5 months ago and ever since getting into our new apartment, our male cat, Pippin, has been doing this thing where he’ll bring us one of his toys, a stick with a bell and rope attached and feathers on the end. Every time he does this he starts meowing and will find us wherever we are in the apartment and usually won’t stop until we make some acknowledgment of it. He never did this before we moved and our female cat doesn’t do this either. I’ve had cats most of my life and never experienced it, but this is the first time I’ve had fully indoor cats, so maybe that has something to do with it. It’s been increasing in frequency to the point that he does this almost every night. A few minutes after we get in bed, we’ll hear him start meowing and dragging the toy down the hall. About half the time he’ll jump on the bed to bring us the toy and once we say hi to him, he just lays down like normal. This happens occasionally (about every few days) during the day as well. It’s not a problem but I have also noticed that when he does this, he’ll sometimes make a motion kind of like he’s trying to cough up a hairball but doesn’t make any sound and doesn’t drop the toy when he does this.

I've been working on making it obvious that she hurt my hand if she bites too hard and will stop petting her and turn away from her and try to pet her again once she's calmed down, trying to reward her with affection when she let's me pet her without biting. 

This seems to be helping a little bit maybe, but it's hard to tell since I don't have guests over very often.

184,1669191695,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi guys 

So my cat Blue is a very well behaved boy and I trained him to go to the toilet outside when he was little with no problems.

I moved house in August and kept him in for 6 weeks with his litter tray. When he started going outside, I got a cat flap fitted and naturally he started finding an outside loo and I took the litter tray away. 

There are some new big bully cats he’s had a few stand offs with and now he’s a bit afraid of going outside, even nipping out to the toilet. He’ll go if I’m out there with him, but I can’t always keep an eye on when he might need to go, and I’m not always in.

I started trying to associate the outside with “good things” so would give him his breakfast outside and sit with him, and have also been hiding treats around the patio which generally keeps him entertained. 

However in the last couple of weeks,  his go-to before he even thinks to go outside is finding corners in the house to go to the toilet. It’s very frustrating for obvious reasons, and this morning I have had to reinstate the litter tray because it’s become such a regular occurrence and I don’t trust him in the house anymore. It doesn’t help that it’s very rainy where I live which is an extra reason he doesn’t always want to go outside. 

I don’t want to have a litter tray forever, and feel like we’re regressing! Has anyone experienced this and have any tips/advice for retraining your cat to go outside / rebuilding lost confidence?

189,1669175527,self.CatAdvice,True,"Looking for advice on this situation as I’ve contacted the RSPCA multiple times and they are unwilling to help and never update me. My neighbour has 2 cats (brother and sister) which they have abandoned, I waited 4 months then finally called the RSPCA when she left for 4 days over a weekend and they were left in the freezing cold starving. The last 5 months I’ve had no choice but to feed them or they would starve. I’ve even tried to not feed them for 2 days but they would cry from morning to night meowing at every door and window. Eventually I got to the point where I felt so bad I would cave in and feed them. I knew they weren’t my cats so never wanted to make them feel confused however she completely doesn’t care I have watched her when a delivery man knocks at the door, the cats have ran in and she immediately throws them back outside. It’s not the case she has no money as she constantly gets food deliveries and various parcels. These were house cats but since she got new furniture etc they were kicked outside in the summer. There is a girl that is very needy and she is now at my house day and night doesn’t even leave the garden. The boy however is very feral and looks very depressed, he is very withdrawn he doesn’t like being touched for too long and hides in corners. Within the last days I have seen the RSPCA visiting her yet so I know 100% they are her animals yet nothing has changed.

190,1669165133,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I have three cats and I just moved out of my parents house for the first time into a spacious two bedroom apartment by myself. My oldest cat I've had for five years, then there's the ""outside cat"" I took with me who is three years old. Then I have a young one who is only a year and a half. My young one is the kitten of the ""outside cat"" and has been indoors since she was old enough to be separated as I somehow convinced my parents to let her in.

So, the problem is I moved to a new place four days ago and my youngest cat went into shock mode. She stopped eating and was hiding which is very unlike her. She's an energetically playful cat and very, very food motivated so it's depressing to see her like this. She's slowly coming around but her playful energy hasn't been restored and I'm fearful she might be lonely during the day while I'm at work. My apartment is also in a big complex so there are little noises here and there too that she seems to be sensitive to; my parents live in a rural country home with no background noise.

She loves the other two cats, but I think she misses my parents more than anything. My dad gave her a lot of attention and he's retired, so he was home with her all day. Both my parents are not cat people but they love her and practically begged me to let them keep her. Now that she's with me, I'm having doubts on whether or not it's right for me to have her. She doesn't seem like herself and I know she'd probably be happier in her old home with somebody who will be with her all day. But then again, I've had her since she was born and I also love her a lot and would miss her.

Would it be better to bring her back to my parents or keep her? I've been an emotional wreck and so conflicted over this because I don't want to give her up but I want what's best for her. I really want more opinions to help me come to a concrete decision; I know cats are sensitive to change so if I choose to bring her back, I would want to do it soon so that I don't further traumatize her.

Also, for reference, I live two hours away from my parents and would not be able to see her often.

200,1669145070,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello everyone!

My partner, and I recently took in a 6yr old cat(D) from a rehoming situation. We already had our current 7yr old cat(R). R suffers from feline herpes, and has always been on a grain free diet to help with those symptoms(whether it does or not is another question in itself, feel free to voice your thoughts.) D suffers from urinary issues, and came to us with urinary care dry food that he never seemed to avoid, and ate R's dry food. We have since switched him to R's dry food, and put him on Authority Urinary Care wet food for this reason. R's wet food is Purina Beyond grain free, and the current dry is Purina One True Instinct grain free.

We are looking to switch their foods to something to possibly help with weight loss for R, as he is overweight. We don't have any concerns with D's issues, and wouldn't consider him overweight by any means but he definitely could make his way to being a chonker very easily. An option we have found is Authority Hairball Control + Weight Management dry food. They also make a wet Healthy Weight food.

My question I guess is... are we better to switch R's wet food to the Healthy Weight stuff, and leave them both on current dry food... Switch R over to the Authority wet/dry weight food, but also give D the new dry food!? OR just switch the dry food for both, and leave R on his current wet food.

Is there better options for weight wet/dry out there? That was the best budget friendly option we could find. Hills was an option but is on the higher end of budget range.

202,1669141231,self.CatAdvice,True,"**I posted a similar post on** r/AskVet **but haven't received any response. :( I hope this isn't against the rules, as a disclaimer I am open to anecdotal experience &amp; opinions because I haven't been able to get a straight answer from a vet either in-person or online!**

**Tl;dr** is -- has anyone tried switching from **Hill's Prescription diet i/d Digestive Care to Purina Pro-Plan EN Gastoenteric? Canned wet food only.** Purina is $67 for 24 cans online whereas my vet office charges $109 for 24 cans of Hill's Prescription. 

I have called multiple vet offices, and there doesn't seem to be a straight answer anywhere. It's a lot of ''I don't know'', including from my vet who said ''maybe there is a cheaper alternative''. Another vet office thought this would work, but in general there just seems to be a lot of uncertainty. 

Reason cat was put on it - basically, he's an old boi who was having some digestion problems and allergies. He is being given an allergy shot now. The vet wants him to be on ''low residue'' food.

203,1669139109,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello all, I currently am the mom to 3 wonderful cats! I will be referring to them by number they were adopted so number 1 is the oldest and 3 is the youngest! 

Number 1 came home as a 3.5 month old kitten almost two years ago. When we brought home number 2 a few months later, it was like soulmates meeting for the first time! They loved each other immediately and have been inseparable ever since so I thought a new kitten wouldn’t be much of an issue.

Fast forward to now and I’ve completely fallen in love with a new kitten and have brought him home. We did the slow introduction, scent swapping, feeding together, and playing together (only positive experiences). There were green flags the whole way through. Not a single hiss or swat. Number 1 was playing with the new baby and zooming around like a kitten again. Now I thought they must be ready to sleep all together last night but number one went completely Mr. Hyde, hissing and swatting like he’d never seen this cat before! (Mind you they were snuggling on the couch just an hour before). He even swatted at number 2, something he normally would never do.

I have a strong inkling he’s possessive of our bed, or maybe he’s possessive of snuggling with me? He’s normally the cuddler and number 2 lays by my feet so there’s never been a rift before. Last night he was being insufferable so I put him in our guest room to sleep. And now this morning, him and number 3 are all good once again! 

I guess my big question is what can I do to benefit all parties? I don’t want to sleep without the baby because I don’t want him being alone, and I don’t want to encourage inappropriate urination for number 1 because I’m alienating him.

We followed the slow introduction advice as best we could. However we have hit an impasse with aggressive chasing. The tabby has always been a bit aggressive with chasing and stalking behaviours.

They've never actually fought outright, but light swatting and growling is common at the end of a chase...

The thing is they can go a day or more getting along and then just start. We have a camera up to record and cannot find a trigger, although the stairs in the house seem to be the area where conflict usually starts.

We are not sure if these are play attempts, something we need to let happen on occasion so they can sort hierarchy, or what to do. FWIW we did just leave it for a weekend and while it did keep happening it didn't escalate.

Note: they are separated at all times if we cannot be there to watch them.

As a side note to this we are really struggling with rewards for the Maine Coon. She has no interest in any sort of cat treats but will absolutely try her luck at stealing chocolate and sweets if they are not watched, so any advice for appropriate sweet treats would be great.

Few weeks ago we mounted the doors on the wardrobes and from then the cat every morning at 5am or so, starts to meowing in front of these doors, and beat his paws very loud against that, he is also very stubborn and goes on for hours till we “wake up” at 7.30am. We can’t sleep and I’m also worried that his loud meowing disturbs the neighbours.

She’s about 3-4 years old. A simple black cat. I had her since i was 19. We had a struggle of life (don’t we all) but we’re making it work as best as we can. her behaviors have been changing recently. i made a post a while ago asking about her eating habits and why they changed. 


She just seems so depressed. My gf suggest my cat is reflecting my mood and energy. Cats are pretty reflective on that. But I don’t know, I don’t believe she is. 


I don’t have any money or transportation to get her to a vet or even have a consistent doctor for her, that makes me feel like shit. I was recently unemployed, but I have an interview set up. I want to give her a good life. I understand my apartment unit is shit and i don’t have an open window or balcony for her. It makes me feel so terrible. I let her roam my apartment hallways when she begs. I let her drink water from the sink. I change and specifically get her turkey pate and wet food. I change my tone when talking to her. I started playing with her more. I don’t even know if she’s gaining or losing weight.  I’m doing the best I can with my deliberating mental/emotional health. 


My perception of all of it really dark and bad. Maybe she’s not dying. Maybe she’s perfectly fine. But to me, I feel as though I’m failing her in every way as a cat father and her best friend. I really don’t know what to do. The other cat I have is doing fine. He eats, plays, and reflective positive energy. He just existing really. 


But Kota? I have no idea what to do, where I went wrong, maybe it my fault for always being broke. I need to do better. I feel like such a failure. I lm fearful of waking up this week and finding her dead. I’m at loss. And I know cats hide themselves when they’re sick or near death, and to me , it seems like she’s hiding or been sleeping in really hidden spots or just on top of this soft blanket I have.

227,1669069996,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi! 
So just like the title says my indoor car has started to turn into a big furry ball. She is 1.5 years and a pretty small cat , should weight about 3.5 to be healthy. She has always been thin and been able to have food freely. These last 2 months I’ve noticed she’s starting to put on some weight and weighs about 4 kg now from weighing 3,5 for her whole adult life and still growing.

I’m having a bit of a hard time deciding how to deal with her feeding because I don’t want her to go hungry several hours a day or night. What I’ve started doing is giving her more wet food since it contains less calories and then she has her dry food to snack on during the day/night. The feeding instructions says that she needs 0.5 dl a day , and that’s without wet food, which I feel is a very small amount of food to feel full on 24h a day, especially when she eats it really fast and then have nothing. I have an activation feeder and a bowl and she always get some in her bowl and a free amount of food in the feeder since she only eats a small amount from it from time to time. And no, I can’t afford feeding her only wet food at this time but will do it when I’m finished with my studies and have a good income.

So my question is , should I stop giving her dry food in her bowl and only keep the activation feeder? I don’t know if she will eat enough then but since she seems to use it even when she has food in her bowl I think it would be a good option.

If else, what is I good feeding routine so that she won’t be without food for 8 hours at night or day. Right now I give her maybe 0.5-1 dl wet food every morning and evening and not sure how often or how much dry food I should give at what times.  I’m currently studying from home so I can pretty much feed her whenever so it’s hard to find a balance. I’m giving food for sterilised indoor cats  btw. 

This is my first time owning a cat so I don’t know how to keep them fit.

228,1669069783,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey everyone, I’m new to the page and Reddit!

My lovely girl Yuki is struggling with peeing and pooping in litter trays. I have had her a year now and it’s always been a problem but it’s gotten much worse now to the point where she doesn’t go in them at all.

I have been to the vet and they have done all manner of tests and determined it has to be behavioural.

She will stand in the litter tray and poop just outside it. We have tried bigger litter trays, closed ones, open ones (all different litter too). You name it we have wasted money on it. We started using puppy pads which she now pees on and not the carpet, but she will also go to the edge of that and poop on the carpet.

I have another cat, she’s about a year old and Yuki gets on with her well and had this issue before she arrived at the house, but I feel I should mention this for context. Yuki is also an indoor cat as adviced by the shelter as she has never been outside and is a little dumb.

We love Yuki so much and I know she had a rough time before us (neglectful owner), but she is making it very hard to keep her at the moment as our flat just smells of cat poop.

229,1669064763,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all! I’m planning on adopting my first cat soon, a 1 year old female. I live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment. I have plans to visit my father over the holidays for about 4 days, and am hoping to take my new cat along with me (all my friends who could cat sit will also be out of town).

She will only have about 3-4 weeks to get comfortable with me and her new home before I take her on this trip. It’s about a 2 and a half hour drive.

230,1669064094,self.CatAdvice,True,"Sorta as the title says, my cats lonely well I'm at work according to my roommate she walks around the house meowing till I get home. She's groomed the back of her front legs naked, I thought someone shaved the backs of them at first only to learn its from overgrooming.  I would've never guessed she was so lonely well I was gone because she's not any clingier when I'm at home, she's always super excited when I get home almost like a dog but she just kinda comes and goes for attention well I'm home.

I've been told I should get her a friend, but she's not meshed well with other cats. Her old owner rehomed her because she was bullying the new kitten they got and well my grandma was staying with us she and my grandma's cat didn't get along. She wasn't slowly introduced to either of the new cats so I'm wondering if we go slow it'd be different? 

My local shelter will let you ""trail run"" adoptions to see if they get along before finalizing so I'm debating on trying that.

Any tips or ideas appreciated. 


Also;
I've tried giving her cat TV and music to chill her when I'm not home, but seems to have no affect. My roommate doesn't hang out with her and likely won't be interested on doing so.

We are moving across the country and we have a 5.5hr flight coming up.

""At the recommendation of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), American Airlines will not accept household dogs and cats that have been sedated or tranquilized. Pets that have been given sedatives or tranquilizers are at a higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular problems at high altitudes.""

I know it is not a tranquilizer, but is gabapentin a sedative? I absolutely do not want to put my cats at risk. Can anyone help me find a resource that has additional information to clarify if gabapentin is a sedative and/or if it poses these risks?

233,1669057643,self.CatAdvice,True,"My 6mo old cat (Felix) and I are here at parent's house the week, and I'm wondering what kind of dynamic we should have with their 3yo resident cat (Max). 

We made the mistake of letting them meet right away. While there was no aggression (towards eachother), they were visibly uneasy. 

Both cats are quite docile, although Max is definitely more sensitive and can get stressed by unfamiliar people or change. Felix is very adaptable and easy-going; he's enjoyed socializing with my parents and exploring the house. He was very submissive and hesitant around Max when they met, and just kept his distance.

But to my surprise, Max was aggressive towards ME. Despite how they were only in the same room together for about 10 minutes (with no conflict), when I later tried to talk to/pet him, he growled, hissed, and even swatted at me. He hissed at my parents too when they tried, but he was significantly more aggressive towards me. 

It breaks my heart because he used to LOVE me, and I'm worried  that he might resent me now?

235,1669057246,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello!

I have two cats, and recently started fostering a third cat. Our kitten, around 8mo, was rescued from a feral mother. She is very food motivated, which has historically made it super easy to train her to get used to things, but I am having trouble with how she interacts with the foster cat.

Half the time, she will completely ignore him - running past him to get into a room, or sharing a space with general disinterest. She is very treat motivated, and will nearly crawl \_under\_ the foster cat to get treats. She isn't defensive about it or anything, they just happily eat treats next to each other. She doesn't seem very smart.

However, our kitten will also chase him around the house, cornering him under tables, watching him like a hawk. She will hiss and sputter and take swings at him occasionally - it does not seem like play behavior and the foster cat definitely isn't reading it as such.

I'm not sure how to disincentivize her from picking fights. The foster cat is much bigger than her, I'm not worried about his safety that much, but he is also a sweet guy who clearly does not want to fight. He would much rather flee.

242,1669043772,self.CatAdvice,True,"so my cat is a lil over a year old, since hes turned one hes destroyed every single pair of shoes w laces my partner and i own. hes chewed through some of my clothes, and anything that looks like it may be a string he chews through it. if wires have that fabric covering, he will chew it - he doesnt go for wires, he specifically goes for things that have fabric / looks like a shoelace. 

hes not allowed in closets, all shoes are put away, and we make any guests w laces take their shoes off at the door and im wary of buying anything electronic that has a string look. i do wanna mention that i make sure to monitor in the case he ingests any string. its like a compulsion he has, thats the best that i can describe it.

244,1669036169,self.CatAdvice,True,"My boyfriend and I recently adopted a 5 year old cat (Bebe) and have had our resident cat (Bowser) for 2 years. We adopted Bebe almost 2.5 weeks ago and have been working on a gradual introduction. Things have been going mostly really great. We’ve gotten them to the point of eating directly in front of each other through a doo and have let them see each other from a distance. 

We started to move them into the same room a few days ago. We keep them both distracted and Bebe does great at first. Bowser (resident cat) is very perplexed by her and spends most of his time observing her play. He is comfortable enough to be briefly distracted by treats. 

This lasts roughly 15 mins before Bebe decides to randomly hunt Bowser and attack him. Nothing serious, just chasing, hisses, and swats. We separate immediately. My boyfriend has read that we should allow them to set boundaries like this, but I’ve read that we should always leave introductions on a positive note.

245,1669030573,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone,

I have a one year old cat who occasionally (once or twice a day) will pee outside of her litter box. She is spayed and according to her vet is healthy. She usually pees in front of doors, like the bathroom door if it is closed or my roommate's door or even the front door even though she does not like the outside. I've been trying to combat the issue by making sure to take her with me when I use the bathroom and my roommate is trying to do the same but recently I went on a trip and had to leave my cat with my roommate and the peeing got worse so now I'm looking for a long-term solution. 

The peeing started about a month after I adopted her (which would be march 2022). Around the same time she fell the bathtub while I was taking a bath. I don't know how significant of an incident it was but the peeing started around the same time. She isn't that squeemish of water nowadays so I don't think that is the reason for it. Also, my roommate moved in a little while after that. 

Here are the solutions I already tried:

1- Taking her with me to the bathroom and keeping doors open (which isn't always possible). 

2- Putting her in the litterbox after meals and after she sleeps. Works somewhat well, except for when I am at work or at night (so half of the time).

3- Changing litters. I use a clumping small pellet litter, which is what vets recommend for these kinds of issues. I scoop multiple times every day and change out the litter every month.

4- Changing her food. She gets wet food each morning and dry food throughout the day. Don't know what else I could do about that. 

She is overall a somewhat nervous cat. She will usually meow outside our doors whenever we close them and meow when we come back from the outside. I've also very briefly given Feliway (the spray version) a try and it seemed to work but I've read very mixed reviews and I wanted to ask here before committing to it. 

At this point I'm pretty desparate to solve this issue and would be open to any suggestions. If you have any questions or need more information, please ask.

258,1668988495,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat is acting weird. 

She gave birth to her first kitten 2 and half months ago. And just like any other mother cats, she was very protective and caring during the first few weeks. Won't let anyone touch/carry her kitten, hide her from us, etc. After 2 months, she's not protective anymore and the kitten is now basically a young cat that is now independent from the mother. 

Of course, these are all very normal but the weird thing is what's happening now. The mother cat gave birth to two new kittens this week. As normal, she's again being very caring and protective of the new kittens. 

But what's weird is that she became over protective again of the first cat. When she's away from her, she would come and pick her up by her neck or ear even though they're almost the same size now and would try to bring her back together with the two new kittens. 

Whenever we try to carry and play with the older kitten, the mother cat would come to us and would try to take her away. It's as if she thinks the older kitten is part of the newborns and her protective maternal instinct for the older cat got renewed? 

Just like other young cats, the first kitten is now very playful and keeps on running around. However, I think this is stressing the mother cat so much as she would always try to bring her back.

I'm thinking of getting the older kitten away from the mother in the meantime while she's still nursing the newborns?

Or maybe this is actually normal for the mother cat and not really concerning?",0,Renewed maternal instinct?,text,281,"['renewed', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'cat', 'acting', 'weird', 'gave', 'birth', 'first', 'kitten', '2', 'half', 'month', 'ago', 'like', 'mother', 'cat', 'protective', 'caring', 'first', 'week', 'wont', 'let', 'anyone', 'touchcarry', 'kitten', 'hide', 'u', 'etc', '2', 'month', 'shes', 'protective', 'anymore', 'kitten', 'basically', 'young', 'cat', 'independent', 'mother', 'course', 'normal', 'weird', 'thing', 'whats', 'happening', 'mother', 'cat', 'gave', 'birth', 'two', 'new', 'kitten', 'week', 'normal', 'shes', 'caring', 'protective', 'new', 'kitten', 'whats', 'weird', 'became', 'protective', 'first', 'cat', 'shes', 'away', 'would', 'come', 'pick', 'neck', 'ear', 'even', 'though', 'theyre', 'almost', 'size', 'would', 'try', 'bring', 'back', 'together', 'two', 'new', 'kitten', 'whenever', 'try', 'carry', 'play', 'older', 'kitten', 'mother', 'cat', 'would', 'come', 'u', 'would', 'try', 'take', 'away', 'think', 'older', 'kitten', 'part', 'newborn', 'protective', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'older', 'cat', 'got', 'renewed', 'like', 'young', 'cat', 'first', 'kitten', 'playful', 'keep', 'running', 'around', 'however', 'think', 'stressing', 'mother', 'cat', 'much', 'would', 'always', 'try', 'bring', 'backim', 'thinking', 'getting', 'older', 'kitten', 'away', 'mother', 'meantime', 'shes', 'still', 'nursing', 'newbornsor', 'maybe', 'actually', 'normal', 'mother', 'cat', 'really', 'concerning']",renewed maternal instinct acting weird gave birth first kitten  half month ago like mother protective caring first week wont let anyone touchcarry kitten hide u etc  month shes protective anymore kitten basically young independent mother course normal weird thing whats happening mother gave birth two new kitten week normal shes caring protective new kitten whats weird became protective first shes away would come pick neck ear even though theyre almost size would try bring back together two new kitten whenever try carry play older kitten mother would come u would try take away think older kitten part newborn protective maternal instinct older got renewed like young first kitten playful keep running around however think stressing mother much would always try bring backim thinking getting older kitten away mother meantime shes still nursing newbornsor maybe actually normal mother really concerning
259,1668986734,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I rescued a little feral kitten, Basil, when she was 10wks old after she appeared my back deck. It has been about a month now and I've successfully been able to socialize her (although she still is a bit skittish) so now I'm starting the process of introducing her to my resident cat, Peaches.

Peaches is 5yrs old and my most beloved nightmare lol She I describe her as the poster child of ""single kitten syndrome"" and I have barely been able to improve her play aggression for the 4yrs I've had her 🥲 She still has the energy of a kitten, and I was contemplating getting her a kitten next year to maybe reduce the violent attacks on my legs, but hey! That's when Basil showed up!

I'm following Jackson Galaxy's method of introducing cats, but these two have accidentally come face to face before-- when I first trapped the kitten and was clearing a bathroom, I accidentally didn't shut the door right and they briefly sniffed each other's noses before I shooed Peaches away. Note that this is a shockingly good cat interaction for Peaches bc if she faces a cat outdoors through a window she typically screams like she's dying. The 2nd time they interacted was again, bc I'm terrible at shutting doors. I entered my office (where kitten is kept) to find Peaches staring intensely at the kitten like she was shocked that this creature was still here lol This time Peaches did hiss when she was picked up, but I think that's more because she was startled 😅

Now, this is where I am getting mixed signals. Room swapping? Not a problem; Peaches sniffed around at first but then just carried on with life. And it's the same thing with feeding on either side of the door! Peaches has no qualms with eating her food with Basil's bowl right up near her-- Peaches actually eats faster than the kitten, and when she's done eating she just walks away as usual! BUT the kitten recently discovered that she can fit her little paws underneath the door, and if Peaches sees her little paw, it's an immediate big hiss 😭? Idk how she can be okay with all the other steps day one, but a little paw and it's game over??

I feel bad for the kitten, bc she really wants to play with Peaches and will try to door-dash if she notices Peaches (Peaches does not notice her bc she is busy begging for the food I bring the kitten lol). Do I move on to the next step of eating with only a screen (or in this case, through the mesh of Basil's giant play pen) or is this a sign that things are going sour?

I'm super worried bc I'll be visiting my parents in a month and Peaches comes with me for that, but this time kitten will have to come with me too! I was so hoping Peaches would be more accepting of a baby cat but alas she still hates poor lil Basil 😢

263,1668984517,self.CatAdvice,True,"For some background: my 1.5 year old male tabby, Ivy, has been with me since I adopted him as a 9 week old kitten. He was the only kitten in the RSPCA enclosure who didn't run when he saw my 43 kg (95 lb) dog Isaac approach, and they were best friends within 10 minutes at home. Ivy goes right up to people when they visit, whether strangers or otherwise, loves pats from everyone. Goes for harnessed walks, even hangs out the car window on trips (harnessed to belt buckle, I promise). So he's a dog cat really. Adventurous, affectionate, smart, curious.

At home, it's been just Ivy and Isaac (who cuddle together all the time and play together occassionally), plus a house rabbit (Ivy would sometimes bully her during play but otherwise they left each other alone), who has since passed of old age. Ivy is an indoor cat but he's allowed access to a cat enclosure thing that allows him to go right to the fence. There, he calls SUPER loudly to the neighbour's cat to play and can often get quite upset when she doesn't show up.

His only semi extended interaction with a cat was when I recently took care of my friend's 1 year old shy female cat named Nyx for a week. Ivy was always very curious, patient, desperate to play but gave Nyx her space. They never quite got to cuddle levels because Nyx was very standoffish, but Ivy came close to winning her over. And Ivy was utterly heartbroken when the week was over and Nyx went back home. He wandered around the apartment looking dejected for a whole day. And he still goes to the fence daily for some cat interaction, which he doesn't always get.

My question is whether these are all signs that I should adopt another cat. I've read a lot of articles and posts warning about the difficulties, but in those cases, it seemed to be with a cat who was being introduced to another cat for the first time. So I was hoping for some tailored advice about my situation. Does the fact that Ivy seems to crave cat interaction mean I'll have a better chance of making a cat pair work? Would it be cruel not to try? (Okay ""cruel"" is a bit dramatic, but you know what I mean.) Even though Ivy is enthusiastic about a new cat friend now, will this fade over time and is there a chance they'll just get into fights later? Is Ivy and Isaac's occasional playtime enough to satisfy him?

For those who vote yes adopt another cat, any advice about age/sex etc? I personally think Ivy is a bit of a ladies' man and would love a female companion around his age, but I'm open to suggestions.

I would honestly prefer not to adopt another cat right now because I live in a small two-bedroom apartment with a giant dog and a cat, so I'd struggle for space. And the idea of adopting a cat only to find that it won't work out is quite stressful. But it also breaks my heart to hear Ivy calling out to the neighbour's cat to play and getting no response.

As a compromise, I was actually thinking of waiting until Isaac passes, since he's quite old, and adopting another cat then, to help both Ivy and myself grieve. This may not happen for several years, however, and I do feel bad for Ivy in the meantime.

Thanks to anyone who read through all that!

266,1668979598,self.CatAdvice,True,"5 months ago we found a kitty(Romeo) all alone on our farm. Decided to take him into our home as we couldn’t bring our selves to just leave him there. Very cute, innocent and tiny. He had fun with my other cats as he was smaller but now its getting out of hand as he is bigger and faster now

My other cats are Rick (4.5yrs old) and Cheeto (3.5yrs old) are very peaceful and sometimes play fight with each other. Now romeo, while he was tiny, would play fight with rick and cheeto as much as he could. Typical fun kitten behavior that was really fun/cute to watch. The problem now is Romeo with his kitten levels of energy is a little too crazy. He sprints full speed and attempts to mount both rick and cheeto on sight every day and every opportunity he gets. Rick is a stronger, more “alpha” cat while cheeto is the definition of a scaredy cat, pretty weak, innocent and affectionate which im totally fine with.

My problem is my other cats are starting to slightly change and I can tell sometimes they are distressed. My main concern is cheeto because romeo can smell the weakness off cheeto and enjoys what id consider bullying cheeto. Sometimes I catch him just growling when romeo is in the vicinity. I understand its the age difference and energy levels which contribute to the incompatibility but my family is starting to get annoyed and although they like romeo, due to his behavior they dont like him as much as the other cats because of his behavior. I can live with them not really playing with romeo as my family doesnt really know what goes into cat owner ship but I play with romeo 2 hours a day and it’s difficult playing with him that much just for his energy levels to be at 90% and launch at my other cats. Cheeto yelps is very vocal as he’s being chased as he runs and Rick play fights with romeo One out of every 10 times Romeo chases him. But when Rick is hissing telling him to f off essentially romeo doesnt stop, same with cheeto. Romeo always tries to bite the back of Rick‘s leg near his butt and it looks like Rick is really bothered by it.

I really need romeo to take it at least one step back and not bully my other cats. I really feel that romeo knows what hes doing is bad but he gets off to it. How do I get him to stop attacking cheeto on sight? I understand kittens are crazy but I think hes taking it too far. I keep cheeto in our big/nice basement with all his necessities with the door to upstairs closed as he spends most of his time down there anyway. 
It’s really difficult doing this on my own and I don’t want my family to continue being annoyed with him. I don’t know where to find a professional behaviourist or at least a reliable one. Will neutering Romeo bring this behaviour down a notch?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much

My significant other and her sister recently adopted a stray kitten 2 months ago. They've separated the kitten to be downstairs and their 6 year old cat upstairs.

They feel bad their older cat can't explore the house like she used to so they've tried bringing her downstairs (when the kitten isn't around) to explore but she's just constantly meowing. It's sounding like a sad meow too. Is there anything that can be down to help calm down when she's downstairs and explore more?

They would rarely ever use the bathroom outside of the litter box, like once a month max for the last few months, and then this month it started going down hill

They nearly daily use places other than the litter box. Important papers my dad needs, kitchen, living room, almost any piece of paper or plastic that gets left on the floor, no matter if there are things in it or not

I have many questions about this since I'm inexperienced. Also, this doesn't have to be the case, but I'd kinda like to just stay single... Would 3 cats be hard for a single, working person? I could go for 2 instead.

I've looked at some breeds and found some I really like, but would having a Maine Coon, Ragdoll, and a Snowshoe be hard/expensive/bad? Should I just go with less pricey/rare breeds?

Also, since I'll be single and working, I've read maybe 6 months would be the youngest age I could leave them as I work. Is this fine?

Would it be better to just adopt one? Or would it be hard to find?

282,1668957440,self.CatAdvice,True,"In short: got new cat, he's fairly young (little less than a year, don't know the exact age) and he's stubbornly getting into everything, and when I stop him he pisses on stuff he shouldn't 

I have a shelf in my room where I grow some plants under a grow light (there is no window!!) and he's become hellbent on getting up there--probably because he knows it gets my attention. I've done everything in my power to block off the shelf, and he still barges through it all, even if he falls or it's nearly impossible to make the jump. When I remove him from successful attempts, he finds something in my room other than the Two Whole Litter Boxes in the room to pee on. 

He's gotten along great with the other three cats, even plays with the younger two regularly. I thought he was doing this because he was restless, so I started playing hard with him before bed. Then I thought he was obsessed with the shelf because I kept the cat food in the cabinet, so I moved it out of the room. Finally  because he ended up getting up earlier than me, I decided to start opening my room door so he could go downstairs with the other cats while I finish sleeping. Nope, he still comes back in and tries to get up there, and once more when I remove him, he guns straight for my closet or chair to piss on something.

I'm at the end of my rope. I'm writing this after being woken up by him jumping up there AGAIN, and I've shut him out before I boot him from here to the moon, but that's not a long term strat either because my other cats favourite litter box is in here. I honestly do not know how to manage this behaviour, and any advice would be great before I wring his skinny little neck (this is hyperbole, I would never harm any of them, but boy does he fucking test me)

Feel free to ask for more details, too. If it's relevant, I suspect he's albino and he certainly seems to have some vision issues.

Manju (Mauhn-Jew) • Male • 18 months • Feral • had since four months old • adopted Sep. 19. 2021 (First Kitty)

Peanut is Butter • Female • 20 months • Spaded • had since 6 months old • adopted Oct. 11. 2021 (Second Kitty)
 
Fae • Female • 14 months • Spaded • had since 13 months old • adopted Oct. 14. 2022 (Our New Kitty)

Midnight • Neighbors cat who is always at our house, eats &amp; sleeps here most of her time • Female • about 8 months old • Unsure about being Spaded • Neighbor found her at 2 weeks old, been coming here since four months old • (Not ours but came in as Third Kitty) 

So our new kitty, who we had for a little more than a month, keeps being bullied terrorized by our first cat Manju. Manju is usually the most friendliest of all cats, &amp; of all the cats we thought Manju would be the first person to take to her, but he wasn’t. Everytime he sees her, he makes his shoulders big &amp; turn into a gorilla &amp; chases her down looking like he has gorilla shoulders &amp; smacks her, with claws. I’m not joking, he actually resembles a gorilla. i know it’s him showing dominance. My bestfriend says he’s getting “bigger” because she made him feel “small” when he was trying to get to know her.

in reality, i know I made a few mistakes when introducing.

1. Fae was in the house when Manju was outside laying &amp; playing around (gone) with the other cats in the backyard. so he wasn’t home when she arrived.
2. I wasn’t aware of Fae’s personality before I adopted her. now i do see that plays a big major role. (learned alot of lessons this last adoption) her personality is very scary. Like she’s extremely scared of everything. i think before the person she was adopted from. (it was an older lady who had Fae since about 7 months, so she had her for about 6 months before we adopted her, said that Fae is the only cat she was allergic to &amp; had to give her away but didn’t want to surrender her to a shelter. after she gave Fae to us, she got a new cat the following week &amp; says that she’s not allergic to this one.) Fae doesn’t really have any extremely concerning behavior issues, but she is scared of everything. When Manju is out the house, she free roams, smells everyone’s butts weirdly a lot, loves to play, loves to be pet, doesn’t really socialize a lot , very to herself most of the time, all movements &amp; noises scare her. I think before the last woman, she was somewhere where she had to fend for herself &amp; it was dangerous. I would say, most times it’s not dangerous in our house but it does get a little worrysome whenever Manju wants to attack her. This happens about 2-3 a day. 
3. When Manju met Fae, for two days he would go up to her sniff her &amp; always lay by her. Later on the second day, he was smelling her face again, she hissed at him, swatted him &amp; ever since then he’s been going gorrilla mode every single time he sees her.

Peanut Butter doesn’t really care about Fae too much, Manju hates her, Midnight plays with her a lot &amp; Fae plays back but Fae body slams her a lot &amp; Fae plays extremely hard, so I’m always confused if they are playing or it’s serious. 

All of the other cats go outside, lay in the sun, climb the trees, lay on our roofs, play in the grass, &amp; Fae watches them from the window all the time. Fae is too scared to go outside. 

I feel like is Fae wasn’t as scared &amp; more free flowing she would have gotten along well with everyone but She’s extremely scared. Now I feel like she’s found herself in an environment, that she’s not always getting attacked but it does happen. She definitely feels happier when everyone’s outside because she freeroams, She’s free roaming the house when Manju is outside, &amp; the other cats are inside.

But i’m reality, i’m just concerned &amp; dk what to do. I’ve tried to get them both to accept eachother, but Fae will just swat at him when he isn’t doing anything &amp; he’ll turn into a fucking gorilla &amp; swat her when he sees her. 

Honestly i feel like she’ll do better in a home where there’s no other cats. but i also don’t want her to just be passed around because she’s been going home to home but now in my home, she’s not fully safe whenever Manju decides he just wants to go gorilla.

I would love to find a solution to how to make them co-exist but i’m starting to feel like it’ll just be better to give her to someone who can provide a better home for her, a safer home.",0,HELP!

288,1668938570,self.CatAdvice,True,"For context, one of the requirements for my university degree is to spend a few months (at least three) abroad (which is classicist gatekeeping in the first place imo, but we're not focusing on that right now). 

Anyways, I'm two and half months into my semester abroad, and will be back in the middle of December. My cat has been staying at home with my roommates the entire time, because I couldn't take him with me and also didn't want to put the stress of moving on him. My roommates have been caring for him perfectly and also send me pictures every week or so. I'm not worried at all about him not being cared for. What I *am* worried about is him just completely forgetting about me. 
He's a typical ""covid baby""; he was born during the first year of the pandemic and as a consequence I was stuck at home with him for the first few months, meaning he's very used to me being there for him *all the time*. In the past, my roommates have said that when I leave for my parents' for a weekend or so, he will scream for me for a day before finally calming down. As soon as I came back, he'd be at the front door, screaming for me and checking I'm okay before ignoring me for a day or two (out of spite? I don't know why he does that, but it always felt like a ""you ignored me and left me here for *so long*, so now I am going to ignore *you*!""). 
I am scared that he will do this again, but longer, since I've never left for such an extended period of time before. I'm also scared he will have forgotten about me entirely.

I need some advice on how to plan for my 2 cats while I’m away on a month long trip back at my parents’ in India (jan-feb). I currently live in Ontario Canada. I have 2 cats - 2.5 and 1.5 year old male neutered. I am speaking to friends as well but in case they cant watch them i need to plan for a backup option. My brother was supposed to watch them but he may he starting a job in another city. I have a roommate too and she has been good to feed them sometimes but she goes to stay with her bf sometimes and she may not be down to look after them religiously for a month. She also works 12 hours a day on the weekends. 
If boarding them with my friends or my brother doesnt work out, my plan is to get a house visit 1 or twice a day (from Rover) to feed them and pick up their litter. They might get some human interaction n will get to stay in their home instead of being relocated. Is this too less for a month? They dont need a ton of entertainment and I’ll make my peace with it till im back. Price wise this would be expensive, 40-50 bucks a day :( i need some advice on how to proceed with this.

I had a cat that I loved more than anything and whenever I left to go to my Dad's, my mom would always do a shitty job at taking care of him so he would try and run after me and just get lost. Whenever I came back I would find him being taken care of by these 2 kids down the street and bring him home.

One day in the cold of winter  I came back to my Mom's and went down to the kid's house and he wasn't there, I haven't seen him since.

It's been a little over a year now and I've been wanting another cat, I don't want to make the same mistake again--so I thought of just taking them with me.

296,1668922274,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey all. My fiance and I adopted two kittens back in June, one was 8 months old (Brown Tabby), the other (lynx point Siamese domesticated mix), 6 months. I sit here watching our two girls groom each other as inspiration for this post. 

We visited our local shelter back in June and fell in love with these two kittens. While they both came from Texas, they never actually interacted and obviously came from different litters. 

I see people here say that it takes days to weeks to introduce cats. Well...we didn't wait, and did not ease into it at all. We were going to, but just felt as if we didn't need to. 

When we brought them home into our home, we put their cages face to face for about 30 seconds. Then, we let them out of their cages. They sniffed each other, and within, without exaggeration, a minute, they were chasing, tumbling, playing and clearly having a blast and were obviously enjoying socializing. The tabby gave a quick hiss after about 10 minutes...the other kitten respected the boundary, sat for a bit, then they continued playing. They got along so well, that we felt okay leaving them alone in a room together over night! 

We woke up the next morning for work to find them cuddling. Fast forward 5 months, and nothing has changed. They love each other and are the best of friends. They still play and tumble and chase and groom. The tabby will usually give a hiss when she doesn't want to play, and the Siamese mix always respects the boundary and there's never been any hard feelings. 

As I read more about this, I see most people take weeks to introduce their cats. Maybe we weren't wise to introduce them immediately, but I've never seen two cats get along like this.

Hi,

A friend of mine has a neighbor with an 8 year old male cat who has not been using his litter box for a few months and has been relieving himself on the sofa, in his cat carrier, etc. instead. He's only recently started doing so for about two months, although he's been house-trained and had been good about using the litter box until then. They took him to the vet to get him checked out health-wise--apparently he's fine, and the vet suggested that there may be an environmental factor. The neighbor is an elderly lady who has some dementia issues, so it's likely that she had been unable to properly take care of him. They've also reached out to the local cat rescue agency, but they want the cat to be chipped and fully vaccinated before taking him in. The elderly lady wasn't sure of how many vaccines the cat had received and likely does not have enough money to pay for getting him chipped, etc.

I'm considering taking in the cat to see if he can fare better in a less chaotic situation, but wanted to ask for advice on how to prepare myself in taking in a likely very stressed out cat with litter box issues (Aka, how to prepare him to get adjusted to the new stressors of moving, what things would be best to entice him to use the litter box, what materials would be best to clean cat waste, etc.). I would also be happy to hear of any other potential avenues forward for this kitty.

Any and all help would be appreciated!

I gave her the miralax for a few months and but discontinued, concerned about the side effects of long time use, and there has been no change in her stool or coughing since stopping.

So I built a shelter for winter out of reflexive styrofoam in a plastic bin with a 6 inches opening. He fits in snuggly but won't go in. I tried putting treats and catnip inside, he still won't. Any tips to get him to use it? 

I'd really like it since he still likes to go outside even though it's freezing and there's a lot of snow. He's good for coming back in time for his insulin shots, but I still would like him to have a shelter outside so he can stay out as long as he would like (and because sometimes he runs out when were not careful, even if it's not the best time for him to be outside).

327,1668872095,self.CatAdvice,True,"TLDR: My ex's cat  loves me and is constantly crying for my attention, but my ex is moving out in a few months. I feel terrible ignoring the cat, I love the cat, but I'm worried the cat will be a terror to my ex after he moves out. How do I make this process easier?

Rambling version: My ex and I split after 7 yrs (amicable) and we have 3 cats (all fixed). 

2 (male and female) are mine from before we started dating, 1 (male) is his who we got as a kitten 2 yrs ago. His cat LOVES me. Constantly cries for me to play with him. Gets destructive if I don't. Extremely high energy boy, needs a lot of exercise and play. One of the smartest cats I've had in my life. 

Recently I stopped playing with him, and instead I tell my ex he needs to play with his cat (which he does, but usually distracted by his phone or only for 5 mins at a time, so cat comes to me after). I'm trying to ""wean"" the cat off of me so that he isn't a destructive terror when my ex moves and it's just them. 

I feel absolutely terrible though. I love this kitty and it breaks my heart to hear him crying all the time. I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing or not.

331,1668864818,self.CatAdvice,True,"     So to begin, I'm in my 3rd home at 17y/o with my truly extraordinary catto named Rocky. Due to some unfortunate circumstances we were forced to leave said 3rd home and in doing so my family had split apart and started doing their own things. From this event I had to move very very suddenly into my new home (of which my room is miniscule and is the only room Rocky can be in, explanation for this further down). Here is some backstory on my new home and the animals that live here. 

     So during Rocky's first 3-4 years of life he was steadily gaining privilege to go outside unsupervised. (I live in coyote and raccoon territory and God knows what else, so I had trained him to come back into my home before dark and to let him out after dawn for his further safety.) Now I will introduce 2 other cats that are a large issue, A older but 1.5x larger cat than Rocky, named Buddy, and another 1.25x larger black cat named Jet (Rocky is about 12.5lbs for reference as to these cats sizes). These 2 would always antagonize Rocky whilst he was outside so they absolutely hate each other.

      Now to where this all comes together, so the home I was forced to move into, the lady/roommate/landlord Kim owns 1 dog and somewhere between 7-9 different cats. 2 of those also happen to be Buddy and Jet. So from this sudden move into a shoebox sized room with my indoor with outdoor privileges cat where I am near forced to contain him solely to my room. He has been neutered as well and so has Jet and Buddy, and he has 24/7 fresh accomodations so he doesnt feel as bad about being stuck in my room. 

     Yet, regardless of this, I can still tell he's depressed and anxious and longs to go outside. I live in a mountainous region where we will likely get snow consistently soon from the winter storms. I was planning on constructing a catio for him and still think that's a good plan, but I want knowledge of every option at my disposal as to, hopefully, help Rocky be happier. I don't think I can leash train him in my room as of the extremely small size but I'm not sure so that's why I'm asking these questions on here.

340,1668826626,self.CatAdvice,True,"I'm a bit worried about whether my 1 year old cat is getting enough hydration as I don't see her drink that much. She has a wide water bowl (to avoid her whiskers touching the side) and a pet fountain but I've never seen her drink from the fountain (just try and hit the water with her paws lol). I stayed buying her bottled mineral water and she seems to drink from her bowl a bit more now but not that often, the water level doesn't go down much.

Her diet consists of 1 and a half 100g pouches of wet food a day with some dry food to graze on. She's a very small cat and doesn't eat much but I'm considering upping her pouches to 2 a day with less dry food. Would 1.5 to 2 pouches provide enough hydration that she doesn't need to drink much or is this a problem?

My main questions right now are, is she likely getting enough water with the wet food already or:

1) Should I try adding water to her wet food?

2) Should I add more wet food if she seems to be a healthy weight? She's filled out a little bit but seems to be a good size for her age, I'm worried about her getting chubby

So, we have two in-house cats, Beef(female &amp; neutered) and Kathrine(female &amp; unknown)- but Beef originally came to us as practically feral and very young. We got her fixed, medicated, etc.

Another cat(Spicy Chicken) who looks like Beef in coloring and age and we're pretty sure that they're from the same litter- has finally warmed up to us and has given birth in our indoor porch area. We likely won't be able to keep Spicy Chicken as she's our neighbor's cat (though I say screw them for neglecting her yet still claiming ownership of her) but in the meantime we want the kittens to stay with us since it's getting pretty cold out. And this is actually the second time Spicy Chicken has been pregnant but we're pretty sure that none of the kittens from that litter made it as we saw no signs of them. The worry I have is Kathrine, she's lovely and sweet but not great with other cats and has shown some aggression toward Spicy Chicken in the past. I'm worried that she might not be cool with the kittens but it'll be inevitable that they'll meet.

345,1668822345,self.CatAdvice,True," So back in July I trapped a litter of 5 kittens. I trapped their mother as well and had her fixed and released her (she was feral). Kittens were about 6 weeks old at the time and feral and oh so spicy! I have 2 cats of my own, so I have been taking care of 7 cats for about 4 months now. I’m 7.5 months pregnant and due in January, so I know I will need to give them up at some point. 
I have been rehabilitating them since July and getting them used to people. These kittens were so skittish and shy and still even after 4 months, really need work. I have come to realize that they need more help than I can provide. I have been working with an amazing organization and regularly attending adoption events to try and get them adopted- I have been consistently giving up my weekends to volunteer at these events. 2/5 have been adopted and returned. So the organization offered to let me move them to the adoption center and have a variety of people come in 2x per day to take care of them in order to socialize them. 
These kittens and I have been through a lot together - so Im really attached to them- all of them not just one in particular. I love them all in different ways. I rescued them, rehabilitated them, been through 2 rounds of ringworm with them, loved them, cared for them, fed them, etc for the last 4 months. So, I would like to keep one of them. There are 2 in particular that I have narrowed it down to. One of them a male tabby that you would never know was ever feral. My kids love him and he is great with them. The other a female gray tabby that loves our family but nobody else, really. 
Which one should I keep? 
With the female, I worry about behavior issues when I leave town or have strangers in the home. But I also worry that the female has only ever bonded with me and will never give anyone else a chance. 
I don’t worry about the male, he will be ok wherever he goes - here or adopted out. 
Do I take the female who I know is bonded with us and will likely have a harder time being adopted out? Or take the easier male that everyone in our home loves?

I have a short hair domestic black cat that's 6 yrs old. This issue just started this year. I had my cat checked for intestinal obstruction which everything was fine and no obstruction. I had the cats blood tested for parasites and feline leukemia and both negative. I began giving him this $68 high protein cat food from vets office and he still continued to vomit but not as often. Then he lost 2 lbs. I don't understand what's going on. He has no health problems, an entire 5 years never an issue like this till this year. While losing 2 pounds most his body fat is gone too. 
He drinks plenty of water, uses the bathroom still, plays with the other cat I have and seems to be happy and playful still.

347,1668818499,self.CatAdvice,True,"i currently try to use a purple furminator cat brush to take the snags out of his coat/undercoat every day if i can. i try to switch off between a positive interaction with him, like petting him  scratching him letting him smell and bump me, and a negative interaction like the furminator. when i approach with the furminator i try to give a nice scritch with my hand where i want to brush, then show him the furminator, go over it as much as he lets me with the furminator but within a few strokes of the brush he’ll usually start turning to bap or bite at me and i pull away. if he gets upset once but doesn’t seem too terribly offended then i sit for about a minute and then repeat the scritch, show, brush routine. sometimes he’ll let me go at another brushing or two but other times he decides to be done by moving away or instantly reacting every time i bring the brush to his coat.

348,1668818252,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a reactive dog at home and I need some suggestions for how to quickly make sure that he gets adjusted to kittens. My roommates and I are planning to adopt 2 kittens next year to take care of in our apartment. Two of my three (four including myself) roommates have experience with kittens, so taking care of them shouldn't be a problem. My concern lies back home. My family dog is an anxiety riddled five year old miniature Australian Shepherd. He has always had issues with other animals and people, often barking and growling at any sudden movements, but adjusts relatively quickly. He's never had issues with attacking other animals except for the occasional nip at other dogs at the park when they get too close to me (he's a big barker and chaser as he's a herding dog). Despite this knowledge, I'm unsure how he'd react to a cat, especially kittens. He's never been around one before, the only non-dog interaction was a bunny that he didn't care much about. Ideally I wouldn't take the risk of introducing him to kittens, especially since I intend to get them from a local rescue, but I am obligated to get them registered as Emotional Support Animals. I have depression and have struggled a bit this year without my dog to keep me company. The apartment complex we will be staying in is one of the few locations that we will be allowed to stay in next year, and the only one that doesn't require a subway. They don't allow normal pets, but they do allow ESAs (Emotional Support Animals). I initially intended to get a dog, but my roommates and I agree that cats would likely be easier. Due to them having to be registered as my ESAs, and my roommates being unable to take them home, I have no choice but to taken them home over winter break, and any other long term break.

I've been considering the idea of bringing the kittens home 2 weeks before the semester start date to get them adjusted to my dog. I'm hoping that if they're introduced at a young age, even for a short period of time, that their inevitable reintroduction for winter break will be much less stressful. I'm sure that a longer introduction period would be better but I need to work most of the summer to make enough money to last me through the semester, and support the two new babies! I was wondering if two weeks would be enough, and how to ensure that my dog and kittens meeting goes as seamlessly as possible. I've read quite a bit about slow exposure, so I've been planning to do that. I'm mostly concerned that since he barks quite a lot that they could end up traumatized.

Another concern I have is how to avoid damage to the apartment furniture. Is there a way to keep cats from scratching, and potentially damaging the furniture? I wouldn't normally have an issue (my dog is very destructive) but the apartment comes pre-furnished. Any product recommendations, training, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

I also want to know how much attention kittens likely will need!! They will be coming from a foster home so I'm not sure if that would make a difference. I will try and make as much time for them as possible, but life gets in the way and my dog is quite needy so there might be times where I have to leave them with a family member or alone for periods of time. I want to ensure that they get as much love as possible :)

I'm not planning to get them until late August, I don't even know what they look like (we do have a vision of two male cats: a black one named Noctis, and a brown one named Leon, but we aren't too picky). I just want to make sure I'm not making any mistakes and that I'm as prepared as possible!! Also! Any product recommendations like litters boxes, carrying cages, and towers would be lovely!! I also will be posting this on a few boards just in case.

349,1668817801,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two cats, and I love them both very much. Recently one of them has just been unbearable to own. I'm starting to feel really ashamed because I can't deal with him anymore. My live in boyfriend of 3 years abruptly left and moved out a little less than a month ago. 

Ever since then one of the cats we owned together has become so destructive and so bad. Every morning I wake up to all my cabinets being opened, glasses shattered all over the floor, every one of my belongings in my kitchen and or living room all over the floor, and food from the pantry distributed over the house. He was never like this before. He used to be bad sometimes (like all cats), but it is getting pretty out of control. 

I have owned cats all my life and have never seen one get this destructive to the degree where dishes and plates are consistently being destroyed which is also a hazard to the cats themselves. I live in an old house and have tried securing all the cabinets several times, but nothing seems to work. 

I just don't know what to do, and I feel bad because I know they are both probably stressed out because one of the pivotal people in their lives abruptly left and was never seen again.

355,1668808116,self.CatAdvice,True,"This is a weird story, I think. It started last night. 

I have two cats: Rosie is 5 and my sensitive girl. She's very sweet, but skittish and scares kind of easily, but that's actually been getting better. Then there's Phinley: my sweet, funny boy. He turned 2 in July. He likes to play a little more rough than she does, but they seemed to have figured that out. She actually plays by herself when she's in the mood. He's the same way now. There's never been much strife between them that I could see, except for once when Rosie (I think) came back from a dental cleaning last year and he treated her like a complete stranger for several days. They hissed and growled at each other, and made that weird noise that cats make when they're freaked out; that lar-a-lar-a-lar noise. We also just got back home from 9 months in California. They were fine there, but Rosie wasn't happy. She just slept a lot in her little scratcher bunker. She's been a lot better since we've been home. Happier, more comfortable and content. My girl. 

So last night, I was sitting in bed while she was curled up in my lap asleep. Phinley was in his little cavern bed on the floor, maybe 5 feet from the bed. All of the sudden, Rosie jerked awake and flew up into the air like something scared the hell out of her. Or hurt her. She took off for the living room as soon as she hit the floor, with Phinley right behind her. When I walked out there, I found him half wedged under the chair, and heard growling and hissing, so she was under the chair as well. That's one of her safe spots. So he hears me and crawls back out. I figured she needed a minute (or several), so Phin and I chilled in the bedroom again to give her time. Then I went to check on her. She was in a different spot, and when she saw Phin, she hissed and growled and ran up the cat tree. He took off after her and made that weird warble sound. I hadn't heard that in a while. 

Basically, it's still like this. I kept him in the room with me until about 5am and kept the door closed. She cried all night and they kind of played with each other under the door. It's a weird apartment and the bottom of the door leaves a good sized gap between it and the floor. At 5am, I opened the door to feed them and take my meds. She busted through the opening door and jumped over him, then onto her other perch. He immediately followed her and stared up at her, making that warbling noise again. So I picked her up to get her out safely and when I started to walk out, I felt his claws kinda dig into my legs. Wtf. Like he was trying to get at her. 

Eventually I was able to call the vet and they said to let them figure it out, but to be aware so that I could douse them in water or throw a blanket on them if needed. Ok. I let them see each other. She was in her favorite spot in the back of the apartment. I switched their areas earlier and slept in the living room with him. She's better about being left alone. They've both eaten and done their litter box stuff by this time. Anyways, I open the door and he immediately makes a beeline towards her. She growling, ears down, in the defensive stance on top of the dresser where she loves to sleep. He made that warble noise and is aggressively rubbing all over the spot he's on, occasionally staring her down. Mostly flopping all over and rubbing. Idk if this is a territorial / hierarchy thing, but it was weird. At one point, he did jump up to her spot and they threw paws at each other, spat, hissed, growled. He backed off then; but even now, 7 hours later, he's still trying to approach her and she's clearly not having it. I just picked up two multicat feliway kits and dosed him with gabapentin per the vet instructions. I can't get her to take it and she's under the bed. But wtf?

We have tried over cleaning her cat box, changing litters, changing foods, changing the location of the box. Nothing has worked.

She does 1 &amp; 2 in her cat box usually but is seemingly spite peeing on soft surfaces. She peed on the couch last night which I cleaned thoroughly with enzymatic cleaner. This morning she peed on the blanket at the other end of the couch. Both times staring me dead in the eyes. She has peed on our bed and spare blankets in the past. She goes a month or two without issues then does this a couple times a day for about a week straight. 

I read somewhere to put treats on frequent urination places to associate food with places she shouldn't pee and have tried that as well. It works for a little while then she's right back to it, treats or no treats.

I need help! 
Okay so I am a senior in college and I do in and out of depressive states a lot.. medication isn’t my favorite thing ever and my therapist and my doctor recommended I get an emotional support animal. I’ve already wanted a cat anyways, so I went ahead and looked for a cat! I knew I wanted an older cat because kittens are just too much. But I met a cat named Telly, a 1.5 year old half Persian half whatever neighborhood cat. I met him and his owner and then we set up an arrangement for me to adopt him! A week went by and I picked him up and brought him to my place (I live in a dorm but it’s a studio apartment dorm… kinda big). He was obviously scared at first but within one day he was out and about and demanding pets. He’s picky, only eats turkey flavored food. So he didn’t eat at first because I mistakenly gotten chicken lol. Anyways, it’s been a week. He weaves in and out of my feet whenever I walk.. so I’m constantly tripping over him. If I don’t play with him for like 2 hours.. he isn’t tired and keeps me up all night meowing. And not just meowing, howling. And he stops if I pet him. Whenever I walk to the kitchen he runs after me and gets in my way when I’m trying to get his food, or make my own food… he just wants to be pet! I can’t sit at my desk because he repeatedly jumps onto my lap. If he’s not being pet, he stares at me. Like STARES AT ME. I like to take bubble baths, they are very relaxing. I can’t do that anymore because when I do he scratches at the door, and if I let him in he just stares at me and meows very loudly. Basically howling. I’m trying to ignore it, because if I get mad he doesn’t care because he likes any attention. He literally purrs if I get raise my voice. So yeah I’m trying to ignore him but it’s so hard.

363,1668782794,self.CatAdvice,True,"My partner and I moved to a new country last year. We're only in the third year of our marriage and we were very optimistic about settling down here. So we got one trauma baby and a few months later, another beautiful boy so that she can be happier. It worked out really well until our financial situation got worse because I'm not getting jobs here (racism is prevalant) and my partner's company is not paying us enough or covering some expenses they said they would.


Cherry on top, I caught my partner sexting someone and my life fell apart. I ran back to my country, set up my cats to be more independent (trained them with feeders and whatnot) and ensured that they were well taken care of by my partner. He did a wonderful job with them and they're more happy and healthy brats. I came back to figure out the next steps for us and my future in general. Also, came back because I have no money left. But I'm not coping well here. I wasn't coping well with the move to begin with but now I'm very suicidal and I'm battling severw depression.

I cannot imagine a life without my cats but we are planning to pack up and head back because this whole experience has only depleted our resources and ruined our lives. I come from India and for some reason they have this funny rule about pet transportation.  It states that I have to be in a country for at least two years to be able to take my pets back with me. I don't think I have the mental stamina to do this. Plus, it costs a LOT to take them back.

365,1668778105,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello!
Me and my partner adopted a cat from the shelter about a month ago. She was found on the streets back in August and came to the shelter with a broken leg (which is now healed) and seems to have been a house cat but noone came to claim her. She's two years old and looks to be a British Shorthair (she's not a fan of being picked up for long) and she seems to be used to us and comfortable with us.
Now she's quite active (I do try to play with her daily) and she loves birdwatching from the window, so I think she'd love the outside. We have a harness that she seems mostly okay with, we've put it on her  many times to get her accustomed to it. I know you're supposed to go slow and step by step. We live in a small apartment building, on the first floor and it has a tall fenced in yard, which is where I'd like to take her, going outside would mean going through the hall and down one set of stairs.
So far we've tried to go outside twice, once she wriggled out of the harness while we were putting on shoes by the door. I've adjusted the harness since then. The second time we got her to the door and to go a step into the hall by using a laser pointer and treats but she retreated back into the apartment.
So far Ive been thinking to get her used to going into the hall and exploring there and then moving outside when she gets more comfortable, but maybe I should put her in her carrier and go outside and let her come out and explore then (on a leash ofc)? Just because going into the hall first might take very long and she doesn't know that after that she'll get to go outside. Any advice how to go about it or tips from your experience?
I'm just very anxious to get her outside because I think she'd really enjoy it and it'd be good for her, since our apartment is quite small.",0,Harness training/walking outside an adult cat,text,359,"['harness', 'trainingwalking', 'outside', 'adult', 'cat', 'hellome', 'partner', 'adopted', 'cat', 'shelter', 'month', 'ago', 'found', 'street', 'back', 'august', 'came', 'shelter', 'broken', 'leg', 'healed', 'seems', 'house', 'cat', 'noone', 'came', 'claim', 'shes', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'look', 'british', 'shorthair', 'shes', 'fan', 'picked', 'long', 'seems', 'used', 'u', 'comfortable', 'usnow', 'shes', 'quite', 'active', 'try', 'play', 'daily', 'love', 'birdwatching', 'window', 'think', 'shed', 'love', 'outside', 'harness', 'seems', 'mostly', 'okay', 'weve', 'put', 'many', 'time', 'get', 'accustomed', 'know', 'youre', 'supposed', 'go', 'slow', 'step', 'step', 'live', 'small', 'apartment', 'building', 'first', 'floor', 'tall', 'fenced', 'yard', 'id', 'like', 'take', 'going', 'outside', 'would', 'mean', 'going', 'hall', 'one', 'set', 'stairsso', 'far', 'weve', 'tried', 'go', 'outside', 'twice', 'wriggled', 'harness', 'putting', 'shoe', 'door', 'ive', 'adjusted', 'harness', 'since', 'second', 'time', 'got', 'door', 'go', 'step', 'hall', 'using', 'laser', 'pointer', 'treat', 'retreated', 'back', 'apartmentso', 'far', 'ive', 'thinking', 'get', 'used', 'going', 'hall', 'exploring', 'moving', 'outside', 'get', 'comfortable', 'maybe', 'put', 'carrier', 'go', 'outside', 'let', 'come', 'explore', 'leash', 'ofc', 'going', 'hall', 'first', 'might', 'take', 'long', 'doesnt', 'know', 'shell', 'get', 'go', 'outside', 'advice', 'go', 'tip', 'experienceim', 'anxious', 'get', 'outside', 'think', 'shed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'itd', 'good', 'since', 'apartment', 'quite', 'small']",harness trainingwalking outside adult hellome partner adopted shelter month ago found street back august came shelter broken leg healed seems house noone came claim shes two year old look british shorthair shes fan picked long seems used u comfortable usnow shes quite active try play daily love birdwatching window think shed love outside harness seems mostly okay weve put many time get accustomed know youre supposed go slow step step live small apartment building first floor tall fenced yard id like take going outside would mean going hall one set stairsso far weve tried go outside twice wriggled harness putting shoe door ive adjusted harness since second time got door go step hall using laser pointer treat retreated back apartmentso far ive thinking get used going hall exploring moving outside get comfortable maybe put carrier go outside let come explore leash ofc going hall first might take long doesnt know shell get go outside go tip experienceim anxious get outside think shed really enjoy itd good since apartment quite small

369,1668767356,self.CatAdvice,True,"I was wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks that have worked from personal expertise or any general advice for an upcoming house move. 

Background: we have two indoor cats which are sisters and are just over 2 years old, the new house is about 40-50 minutes drive away. 

So far we have already started to use a calming diffuser in our current property and have one ready to put in the new house to hopefully help calm and also we’re trying to keep smells more familiar. We have put their cat carriers in their room so they get used to it. When we move they’ll go into one room in the new house and be kept there until they acclimatise (with all of their toys and things they recognise). We plan to move in a way which hopefully provides as little disruption as possible (we’ll be moving them and their things last and hopefully get everything out of the rest of the house first).

370,1668766393,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat is constantly peeing on my bed and sofa and I’m starting to feel so hopeless.
A little bit of backstory:
My grandmother found her just a few months old outside and took her in. Since she could not keep her at that time, I took her in. At around 8-9 months, she started peeing on my bed and sofa and I figured that it’s due to hormones and got her spayed. The peeing stopped!
Fast forward, this summer I brought her to my grandmother’s place, since she was living in the countryside and I thought that she would like to run around outside instead of always being in my flat. She spent there 2 months and then my grandmother had to move, so I took her back. I was temporarily staying at my boyfriends place, which was a very small studio. She started to constantly pee everywhere. I thought maybe it was due to a medical issue and took her to the vet, but that was not it. Then I realised that maybe she just does not like the new space since it was so small. So I asked my grandmother to look after her for a bit until I get my place back. By that time, my grandmother had already moved to another place and is living in a flat, so my cat did not spend any time outside when she was with her. She did not pee once, until after a month, when my mom came for the weekend and she peed on my mom’s bed. My mom then brought her back to me since I moved back to my place. And ever since then (about a month) she’s peeing either on my sofa or my bed. She has 3 litter boxes, I clean them everyday. The are all located in private areas, easily accesible though. I thought, maybe she is jealous of my boyfriend (although they always play together, he feeds her sometimes and seem to be vibing well), so asked him to stay at his place for a week and see if that might be the issue. For a few days it was fine, but then the peeing started again. I read that someone had the same issue, so started feeding the cat on the sofa, since cat’s don’t do their business where they eat, however, today while I was on the sofa, she peed on me. The thing is, she is so playful and friendly and does not look anxious or stressing, but of course, I can’t know for sure how she’s feeling. I just don’t know what else to do..",0,Help!

371,1668765193,self.CatAdvice,True,"My gf rescued a baby stray kitten from the street when he was about 1 month old. We took them to the vet, and checked for everything, and all indicated that he is perfectly ok, health wise.

He is now around 5-6 months old, and has been castrated in the meanwhile. He was always very **very** needy, mewoing **a lot** (like - a lot) and asking for attention - which I can't really understand, because we really give him a lot of attention, play with him a lot, and has lots of toys he plays with. 

For the last couple months, he just decided that he would eat everything at sight. All our food (one time he peeled a boiled egg to reach the yolk) isn't safe, and we can't be distracted for 30 seconds, that he'll be having a go at it. He is also incredibly stubborn - we push him away from the food, take him off the table, and he'll repeat it over and over again, instantly, like nothing ever happened. If we leave him alone for a few hours, he'll even try to raid the garbage can! Even as I writing this, he was trying to go for my cereals. Yesterday, we were distracted for 5 minutes, and then noticed we was eating a pepperoni pizza - of course, later on, he would be puking. 

I really don't know what else to do. It can be extremely tiring, and it demands constant attention.

My husband and I rescued a cat after a friend of his found him abandoned in a condo.  We planned to get his medical stuff out of the way before introducing my husbands two cats. They had met through the basement door and were curious about each other. The vet figured he was just around a year old and we got all his shots and neutering out of the way. After his recovery we started slowly introducing the other two face to face and was able to move them into the basement with us. Our most recent addition had discovered climbing on bookshelves, knocking everything off tables and any surface he could. I spend plenty of time playing with them and they have a fairly large box of toys so I didn’t think much of the behavior as it’s a cat.

381,1668734823,self.CatAdvice,True,"Looking for advice as whenever my cat’s behaviour is even slightly out of character, I go into panic, worst case scenario mode. 

My cat is 6 years old and isn’t the most cuddly, but can be when it’s on her terms. She is always waking me up to let me know it’s time for breakfast, and she’s always sitting in the kitchen sink for flowing water (despite her clean, fresh bowl of water - typical kitty). She is only chatty when she wants water or food, and occasionally tells me about her day when she comes to snuggle before bed. 

Today and yesterday she hasn’t been herself. She has been hiding under a chair in the office. She isn’t waking me up for breakfast, but still runs over when she hears me fill it but she barely touches it. She has not been in the sink. She has been walking around my apartment non-stop and has been meowing more than I’ve ever heard her. Also, her ears are very hot (which in itself isn’t super concerning but mixed with the other behaviours it raised some concern). Her tummy and armpits are not noticeably warmer than usual. 

My apartment building has been testing the fire alarms for the last three days, and I am hoping that this has just stressed her out. 

She has food, water, toys, lots of comfy places to snooze. Should I be concerned?

382,1668734777,self.CatAdvice,True,Hi everyone. Our 8 month old has always had a naughty streak. We put everything away where he can't reach because he will break his way into anything and will try eat anything that fits in his mouth..including tissues. Today I had to take some out to blow my nose and as soon as I put it down on the table he jumped up and stole it! Then made a run for it. Once he gets tissues or his favourite ball in his mouth he tends to growl and not let go. For tissues we usually just waft a scent he hates around his nose so he drops it. This time he just withstood it and would not let go. He even had his claws out and almost scratched me while I was waving the smell around his nose. And he hissed as well! He never hisses usually. I had to get the oven mitts out to get it out of his mouth because he can eat a whole sheet of tissue. Any advice on how to correct this behaviour?

384,1668725263,self.CatAdvice,True,"I had heard of single kitten syndrome when I adopted my (at the time) 2 month old kitten from a local shelter. I asked the people working if she was old enough to be adopted alone, asked if I should be concerned about single kitten syndrome, and they assured me that it was totally fine as long as I played with her a lot.

Welllll fast forward a year later and I’ve got a fully grown best buddy with a LOT of attitude. At times, she’s very sweet and loves to cuddle and always welcomes me home with a “?” shaped tail and rubbing her head on my legs. She’s also very funny to play with if she has the right toys.

The problem is I can’t keep up with her. She either destroys her favorite toys (realistic looking bird/rat/bee/moth string toys) within days, or she get’s bored of solo play toys too quickly—even when I hide them for part of the day to try to retain novelty. I feel guilty for getting frustrated when I can’t keep her entertained, and she lashes out at me. Her biting has been getting a lot worse (doesn’t draw blood or anything, but these are definitely not love bites). She’s not interested in being diverted to a toy, so sometimes I resort to giving her a (gentle!) defensive bop and walking away, or blow on her face, neither of which feel super effective either but I don’t know what else to do when she’s hurting me. She also swats and sneak attacks at the guy I’ve been dating, and I can tell it’s really starting to bug him that she’s not warming up with time, even after giving her new toys and treats every time he comes over.

I recently started working a lot more and am now gone at least 6 hours a day, occasionally overnight, and rarely for a couple of days at a time. I got her a cat tree as an attempt to “enrich her environment” but cannot afford to buy her new toys every single week. Any ideas how I can keep her happy affordably and sustainably?

The only thing that keeps me away from getting a cat is the idea of owning an animal and not giving it a family. I want to raise a cat, give it a mate, let them have their litter and be together. Thinking of neutering an animal or having to separate a mother from its litter leaves me feeling troubled.

I know this is unrealistic and a lot of space and money is required for this dream. But the idea of keeping an animal to myself and cutting of that future which I feel is a natural part of life keeps me away from getting one. Having a pet and just it being there for my own comfort and pleasure doesn't sit right with me.

390,1668711580,self.CatAdvice,True,"A little background before I get into my question: I (18m) have had my cat Zuzu (7-8 y/o) since she was around 1 year old. My family and I adopted her from a local shelter as a Christmas present for me in 2016, and we really don't know anything about her past.

Now, getting into my question. I've been wanting to get another cat for a while, as I'm a cat person, and since the passing of my dog a few years ago I've missed having several pets in the house.

She's had some issues with both cats and dogs in the past- she'll hiss at neighborhood cats she can see from the window, and if my sister or family friends ever bring their dog over she'll smack and hiss at them. The dog I had mentioned before was a teenage chocolate lab that we had before we brought Zuzu home. Although she was wary and a bit aggressive at first, she did warm up to him a lot, and they became good friends (never any aggressive behavior, cuddling together, etc). He was a big pushover, and never barked, snapped, or even paid any attention to her when she would hiss at or smack him. This probably played a role in how well she liked him, as any dog with especially high energy or interest in her she absolutely despised. I should also mention that about a year ago, she had gotten a stressed induced UTI after we babysat a friend's dog for two weeks, and we have since refused to have any dog over for more than a few hours.

So what I'm getting at is, would it be a bad idea to see if she would open up to another animal in the house? I know she has the capacity to be chill with other animals, as she was with my lab, but I also worry about causing her any sort of significant stress and getting another UTI. I thought maybe if the cat had a very chill temperament like my past dog that it would be easier, but I just don't know. My desire for another cat aside, I also ask because my mom's boyfriend may be moving in with us soon, and he would likely bring his 14-year-old dog. The two have had a few interactions, and my cat wasn't as aggressive or defensive as she has been with other dogs, but I'm still concerned about it. Any advice or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.",0,Would it be a bad idea to try and socialize my cat?,text,477,"['would', 'bad', 'idea', 'try', 'socialize', 'cat', 'little', 'background', 'get', 'question', '18m', 'cat', 'zuzu', '78', 'yo', 'since', 'around', '1', 'year', 'old', 'family', 'adopted', 'local', 'shelter', 'christmas', 'present', '2016', 'really', 'dont', 'know', 'anything', 'past', 'kind', 'getting', 'bullied', 'fat', 'tabby', 'one', 'reason', 'chose', 'adopt', 'bit', 'temperamental', 'shes', 'amazing', 'addition', 'familynow', 'getting', 'question', 'ive', 'wanting', 'get', 'another', 'cat', 'im', 'cat', 'person', 'since', 'passing', 'dog', 'year', 'ago', 'ive', 'missed', 'several', 'pet', 'house', 'cat', 'however', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'thrilled', 'idea', 'shes', 'issue', 'cat', 'dog', 'past', 'shell', 'hiss', 'neighborhood', 'cat', 'see', 'window', 'sister', 'family', 'friend', 'ever', 'bring', 'dog', 'shell', 'smack', 'hiss', 'dog', 'mentioned', 'teenage', 'chocolate', 'lab', 'brought', 'zuzu', 'home', 'although', 'wary', 'bit', 'aggressive', 'first', 'warm', 'lot', 'became', 'good', 'friend', 'never', 'aggressive', 'behavior', 'cuddling', 'together', 'etc', 'big', 'pushover', 'never', 'barked', 'snapped', 'even', 'paid', 'attention', 'would', 'hiss', 'smack', 'probably', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'liked', 'dog', 'especially', 'high', 'energy', 'interest', 'absolutely', 'despised', 'also', 'mention', 'year', 'ago', 'gotten', 'stressed', 'induced', 'uti', 'babysat', 'friend', 'dog', 'two', 'week', 'since', 'refused', 'dog', 'hoursso', 'im', 'getting', 'would', 'bad', 'idea', 'see', 'would', 'open', 'another', 'animal', 'house', 'know', 'capacity', 'chill', 'animal', 'lab', 'also', 'worry', 'causing', 'sort', 'significant', 'stress', 'getting', 'another', 'uti', 'thought', 'maybe', 'cat', 'chill', 'temperament', 'like', 'past', 'dog', 'would', 'easier', 'dont', 'know', 'desire', 'another', 'cat', 'aside', 'also', 'ask', 'mom', 'boyfriend', 'may', 'moving', 'u', 'soon', 'would', 'likely', 'bring', '14yearold', 'dog', 'two', 'interaction', 'cat', 'wasnt', 'aggressive', 'defensive', 'dog', 'im', 'still', 'concerned', 'advice', 'anecdote', 'would', 'greatly', 'appreciated']",would bad idea try socialize little background get question m zuzu  yo since around  year old family adopted local shelter christmas present  really dont know anything past kind getting bullied fat tabby one reason chose adopt bit temperamental shes amazing addition familynow getting question ive wanting get another im person since passing year ago ive missed several pet house however dont think would thrilled idea shes issue past shell hiss neighborhood see window sister family friend ever bring shell smack hiss mentioned teenage chocolate lab brought zuzu home although wary bit aggressive first warm lot became good friend never aggressive behavior cuddling together etc big pushover never barked snapped even paid attention would hiss smack probably played role well liked especially high energy interest absolutely despised also mention year ago gotten stressed induced uti babysat friend two week since refused hoursso im getting would bad idea see would open another animal house know capacity chill animal lab also worry causing sort significant stress getting another uti thought maybe chill temperament like past would easier dont know desire another aside also ask mom boyfriend may moving u soon would likely bring yearold two interaction wasnt aggressive defensive im still concerned anecdote would greatly appreciated

However, she never picked her up her cat, and when I asked her about it, she told me she cannot keep her anymore and will have to drop her off to the shelter. Long story short I decided to keep her as I’ve grown to love her and couldn’t imagine sending her to a shelter when she could have a loving home with me. 

Now the issues is I’ve had some health issues come up and will have to move move from Canada to Jordan for at least the next 4 months. I want to take the cat with me. It’s a really long flight - about 15-18 hours. Is it okay to put the cat through that? She is used to us being alone at home but when I go back to Jordan there will be more people at home and I am worried about how she will adapt to the new setting. Also, the house is much bigger than my current apartment. 

I just can’t imagine leaving her whole i go away for several months. No one i know can take her in. And my only option is to send her to a shelter which I will absolutely not do.

392,1668708895,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat had a really rocky start to life. We found out she had trichomoniasis after months of vomiting, loose stools, and initial diagnosis of failure to thrive. She initially was obsessed with wet food but was prescribed Hills prescription biome food. Well we could not find the canned food anywhere due to the pandemic shortage so we switched her to the kibble version as that was the only food she tolerated. After putting her on rinadazole, we were able to wean off the prescription food. Since then, wet food has been very rocky and she is extremely picky. One day she will eat it, another day she absolutely refuses to touch it. We eventually caved and got her Tiki carnivore kibble which she absolutely loves, however, it made her litter box smell horrendous the minute she goes in it. We ended up eventually switching to fresh pet Vital cat food and she loved it at first for about a year and the litter box issue disappeared. Now she’s refusing to eat it and will only eat the kibble. We tried introducing wet food again and she wasn’t into it. She’s a very happy cat and loves her freeze dried chicken treats and will eat the kibble so it’s not like she’s refusing to eat all together. I’m just not sure if we should give up on the wet food and the fresh pet all together? Is there a kibble that doesn’t make the litter box smell like death?

393,1668707109,self.CatAdvice,True,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible. My 15 yo cat is recovering from a nasty URI that I suspect she got from one of the cats that frequents our yard. She was my landlord's cat that they left at the house when they moved to be cared for by tenants (weird I know). She needed some expensive medical care for her URI that I ended up paying for, resulting in my landlords handing over ownership.

The issue is that she is indoor/outdoor and has been for her entire life. I would personally prefer to have my cats remain indoors, and if she was indoor only she likely would not have contracted a URI. She doesn't stray from the yard so my concern is the cats that come in from other houses. She has started begging to go back out and I just feel so bad, because I know she loves to bask in the sun and watch the neighborhood through the fence. I do play with her when she's around and would be willing to do that more to keep her entertained indoors...

The other issue is I have 3 roommates and I anticipate her getting out again just by their lack of observation or care. One of them often has a dog visitor that goes in and out so I would need to ask that the sliding door remains closed at all times. I'm considering just blocking any entry/exit points in the yard that I can find to prevent other cats coming around, but I would be risking another expensive health scare.

Thoughts? Is it cruel to make her stay indoors when she's had outdoor freedom for 15 years? Has anyone experienced something similar?

He's really really good with cats and has had cats before, but this is my first run having a cat.  

The cat is a wonderful cat.  She's a little over a year old and very friendly, although she is pretty timid and still adjusting to her new home.

At first, I was really excited!  But over the past week or so, I've been feeling this overwhelming guilt that I am just not doing enough for her and I can't shake it.  It's making me regret adopting a cat and its making it really hard for me to bond with her.

Thankfully, my boyfriend isnt going through this and has been beyond helpful in taking care of the cat and playing with her so she's not neglected.

I really have no intentions of surrendering the cat because of my feelings, especially seeing how happy she makes my boyfriend.

400,1668681051,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi team! A bit of background on our cat: she is a two year old rescue cat who was found hiding inside an industrial ac unit with her four kittens. She has been with us for about 8-9 months. She is normally a super sweet and affectionate gal but is not a fan of being picked up but loves a cuddle on her terms.

Anyways back to the current situation: 

Our lil gal escaped from the house recently after our door to our backyard wasn’t closed properly (we moved into a new place 4 weeks ago and we’re still getting used to the funky latches - totally my fault 😭) she proceeded to spend the day harassing and beating up every other cat on our street. There’s one really sweet kitty who has been coming into our yard and peeking through the glass door checking our cat out. And our cat totally beat this poor thing up under the floor boards of our house making some awful sounds but we couldn’t get to her to break up the fight.

She proceeded to keep running away from us and harassing other cats on our street until we finally were able to catch her and bring her home. She didn’t have a single scratch on her either which was very lucky- I hope the other cats are okay too. As she is normally the sweetest thing I felt like one of those parents getting brought into the school and being told that our sweet precious child is actually the BULLY. 

It’s been a couple of days and she has been pretty shitty with us. She still wants to be near us and be given affection but she is also much quicker to get angry and will bite and hiss which she would normally never do. Maybe I’m projecting but she just looks furious at us all the time. 

Is she just pissy that she had a taste of freedom and we took it from her furry little grasp? Is she just going through a comedown from being so overstimulated? Or is she feeling the guilt of bullying every other sweet cat on our street and just taking it out on us?

It’s pretty early days since her grand adventure terrorising our neighbourhood so she probably just needs some time to chill out. But just curious if anyone knows why exactly she’s become so moody or if there’s anything I should be doing to make her feel relaxed and comfy again?

408,1668671173,self.CatAdvice,True,"I found a perfectly good cat tree in the parking lot of my apartment a few weeks ago, just needed some minor repairs and it was good to go. I took at apart and cleaned it, then built it back up and put it in the living room.

I adopted my cat a month ago, he's an 8yo very polite and mellow cat, doesn't seem to like climbing. however I thought he'd at least sit on the lower/floor parts of the tree, but he won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.

I'm thinking I didn't clean it properly, it probably still has lingering cat smell, so could use some deep cleaning advice. or, he could just be a cat who prefers his cardboard box, as cats do. I've put the tree next to my bed cause he likes sleeping in bed with me, I'm hoping that might entice him as well.

409,1668668081,self.CatAdvice,True,"My boy Morey has been living with me for over 3 years now. He was born and raised in a shelter and I am his first owner.i got him when he was already 4 so he's probably 7 now. 

I tried every trick to get him comfortable with people. The first few months he was under the bed all the time. I'd feed him and keep him in my bed room and would play with him and give him treats.  And besides being too skiddish to let me leave the bed he would be calm around me so I started letting him go out at night. 

He still wouldn't come out under the bed unless I was laying in it. That never changed. Over a year passed and covid hit so I moved my bedroom and made that room my office. I kept a bed and cat tree in there for him and let him get familiar with the room like before. Still working on giving him space and privacy. He was fine there but hid under the cat tree whenever I was in the room. Again if I was seated he would come out but only if I stayed seated. 

After a while in that room I kept the door ajar with a door jam so he could slip in and out as he wanted. But he eventually snuck back under my bed and now won't leave my bedroom. So I tried to accommodate him again. But since then he's been less social and even avoids being social with me. Won't come to me to pet him and hides if I call his name. 

I've tried just leaving him alone but it's been over a year now and nothing has changed. What can I do to get my cat back? Is he just never going to like people? It really breaks my heart that he acts like I'm a threat when all I do is talk in soft voices and offer treats. He will NOT let you pick him up and acts like his life is in danger if you do but he's never hissed when trying to pick him up (you have to corner him fyi) like when I take him to the vet but he does cry and yowl like you're killing him lol.

411,1668665401,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi team! A bit of background on our cat: she is a two year old rescue cat who was found hiding inside an industrial ac unit with her four kittens. She has been with us for about 8-9 months. She is normally a super sweet and affectionate gal but is not a fan of being picked up but loves a cuddle on her terms.

Anyways back to the current situation: 

Our lil gal escaped from the house recently after our door to our backyard wasn’t closed properly (we moved into a new place 4 weeks ago and we’re still getting used to the funky latches - totally my fault 😭) she proceeded to spend the day harassing and beating up every other cat on our street. There’s one really sweet kitty who has been coming into our yard and peeking through the glass door checking our cat out. And our cat totally beat this poor thing up under the floor boards of our house making some awful sounds but we couldn’t get to her to break up the fight.

She proceeded to keep running away from us and harassing other cats on our street until we finally were able to catch her and bring her home. She didn’t have a single scratch on her either which was very lucky- I hope the other cats are okay too. As she is normally the sweetest thing I felt like one of those parents getting brought into the school and being told that our sweet precious child is actually the BULLY. 

It’s been a couple of days and she has been pretty shitty with us. She still wants to be near us and be given affection but she is also much quicker to get angry and will bite and hiss which she would normally never do. Maybe I’m projecting but she just looks furious at us all the time. 

Is she just pissy that she had a taste of freedom and we took it from her furry little grasp? Is she just going through a comedown from being so overstimulated? Or is she feeling the guilt of bullying every other sweet cat on our street and just taking it out on us?

It’s pretty early days since her grand adventure terrorising our neighbourhood so she probably just needs some time to chill out. But just curious if anyone knows why exactly she’s become so moody or if there’s anything I should be doing to make her feel relaxed and comfy again?

412,1668665004,self.CatAdvice,True,"So we took my male cat to the vet and they gave me medicine to give him to see if it would help him urinate better. 
Basically he was yowling and licking himself a lot down below, so I took him to the vet. He would still pee in the litter box but we wanted to figure out why he peed on furniture and why he was acting that way.

The Vet gave me two medicines to give him, Gabapentin liquid medicine and Onsior (robenacoxib) pills. He took them for three days and he’s had a milliliter of the liquid medicine per day according to the Vets instructions.

The problem is he hasn’t peed in the litter box in two days. The Vet needs a urine sample so we put him in my sisters room with food and water so we could try to get it.

Instead he slept all day and didn’t use it, so we moved him into the bathroom with a cat bed to see if that would help. He pooped in the litter box but still hasn’t peed. If he doesn’t use it by tomorrow, we’re going to take him to the local vet hospital.

Rescued my girl from cat rescue (essentially just a room of 50+ cats!) when she was 3mo; now she is 7mo. Toileting and eating routines were healthy and normal from the moment she came home. We could tell early on she was chatty, chirping and trilling when she played with toys. But over the last few months, vocalization has increased excessively—especially at night.

She’ll spend a portion of the night playing independently (lots of chatter there) and looking out the window. But from 3-7am, she’ll start of cycle of going through all the rooms and bedrooms with her toys, trying to get humans to play with her. We used to keep the bedroom doors open, but she’d wake us up bringing her toys into the bed and walking on us. She won’t lay or rest in bed, she just seems to want to play. Now, we keep the bedroom doors closed, but she’ll cry in the doorway until we let her in. No amount of play time before my bedtime (around 10p) pacifies her til morning. All other behaviors are normal, she doesn’t act up, she doesn’t seem unhappy. She just seems… bored.

Which leads me to wonder: does she need a buddy? Would you recommend male or female? Her age or older? What steps can I take to ensure their personalities are compatible?

my male cat, 10 years, recently had a urinary blockage. he spent some time in hospital and came home and has been on gabapentin and a couple other meds since then. when he came home i kept him isolated from my other 3 cats, so i knew when he was using the litterbox and to keep an eye on him. after he got back on his feet i let him go back out in the rest of the house with the others. around this time he became territorial of one of the litterboxes and would attack or corner one of the other cats if they tried using it. then he started stalking them when they were just minding their own business. then he started doing it with the other two cats as well. he has had a history of sexual aggression but never anything like this. it's to the point i have to keep them apart because they can't go 5 minutes without fighting.

So I am in the process of switching my cats litter, I have her regular box set up with 75% old litter and 25% new litter. I have a second box set up with just the new litter in a different spot about 2’ away. (This was my mistake I poured the new litter out first and then forgot I needed to mix my old litter and needed to go buy more, so it’s just two litter boxes for now).

My plan WAS to clean her litter box on this weekend and do it 50-50 but I just need a reality check. 

I had JUST cleaned her litter boxes maybe 15 min before and saw her sniffing around her the box with only the new litter. But she seemed to be tasting it!? I stopped her twice before she left it alone. She did the cat chewing jaw so I think she tasted it, but I couldn’t see from my angle. 

Her old litter is Arm&amp;Hammer Scoop and I am switching to Worlds Best. 

I know Worlds best is corn based but obviously I don’t want her to eat it, and i know eating litter can be a sign of stress or health problems. 

I am now all sorts of worried I am stressing my cat out because I am giving her new wet food (dry food is same) and realize I may have made too many changes and she’s stressed and I feel like such an awful pet parent!

426,1668655384,self.CatAdvice,True,"My bf and I adopted a stray male kitten a couple of months ago. He was 6 months at the time, now he's almost 9. When we first got him he played normally, but for the past month and a half he sometimes will growl after catching the toy and tries to go hide it (usually under the bed). He's even done this while we weren't playing w him - he'll sometimes see one of his stick toys and will grab it and start taking it to hide, but he'll pass the doorway into the bedroom, which has a hanging mouse toy, and try to grab that at the same time. He will then hold onto both toys and try to drag them under the bed, but since the hanging mouse toy is connected to the door, it will put up resistence and he'll growl at it.

He's also become much more destructive of his toys. We can't buy him plush toys anymore cause he'll absolutely decimate them within the first hour.

427,1668655097,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a mother son cat duo, the mother was originally a pregnant stray and we adopted out all her kittens but one, they’re about 2 and 3 years old now both neutered. she’s a pretty timid squirreley cat, occasionally affectionate but usually very independent, the son is more social, loud and clingy. They’ve never been particularly aggressive toward one another besides some territorial growling over cardboard boxes, they don’t mind eating in the same room, they’re civil, but they’ve never bonded. They don’t groom each other, sleep, or play together, sometimes the son tries to initiate play but she starts growling and her body language implies she’s irritated so I separate them. I understand some cats just have conflicting personalities and will never be affectionate to one another, but since the aggression seems pretty situational and one sided on the mothers end I’m wondering if there’s something I can do to help them get along better, or at least help her feel less anxious and defensive about him. 
Some other random context;
-The growling and helicopter ears from mom only seems to happen when she is in my room with me, and the son enters
-she’s more defensive than aggressive, like she’s afraid of him but I have no idea why since in two years I’ve never seen him attack/bother her, he just seems confused by her reaction
-I give both of them catnip, I know it makes them behave strangely but not sure if aggression is a side affect
-she was neutered first, but we had to wait until he was about a year old to neuter the son because appointments were impossible during covid

428,1668653440,self.CatAdvice,True,"I (21) recently adopted a male kitten who is around 5-6 months old about 2 weeks ago. For context, he is neutered and caught up on vaccinations and all that. I basically ""fell in love"" as they say, from volunteering at a cat rescue several times a week and seeing him over the course of a couple of months. Eventually, I realized I would be sad if he weren't there to greet me and I thought I could handle it, so I decided to adopt (with encouragement from my family and friends).

I was really happy at first, went all out buying toys and perches and things. The first days went pretty well too - obviously, there were a lot of adjustments on both our parts, but I was feeling good and I was happy to have a companion. After the first weekend, though, I feel like I've started to freak out. I feel like my adoption was on a whim and out of panic that he would be adopted by someone else and I'm worried I made the wrong choice.

The kitten does what kittens do - climb up all over the counters, eating the houseplants I tried to keep high and out of sight (non-toxic to cats I've checked already), waking me up all hours of the night, scratching me, knocking things all over, etc. I expected some of this, since I had a cat growing up, but I have never had a kitten before (we got my previous cat when he was a few years old already). The issue though is that this is bothering me more than I expected.

When the kitten is on the stove or the fridge, which is where I tried to hide the houseplants, I get more irritated than I ever have been before. When the cat is chewing on the cables or chewing on the plants (even though I got him his own cat grass that is easily accessible) it just makes me...angry. I'm so frustrated by the needs of this creature that I am suddenly responsible for, and that I try my best to provide for him but he still causes problems (I know that's not how cat brains work...but it's hard to change how it comes across to a human thought process). 

As time goes on, I dislike the kitten more and more it seems. I feel bad that I hold his behavior against him, but I don't know how to let go. I know that cats don't respond well to negative reinforcement, but it is hard to overcome the primal urge to scream when I see him jumping on the curtains. After he does those things and then tries to cuddle up to me, I don't feel better - I feel worse. I just want him to leave me alone at that point.

So, is this frustration normal for new pet owners? Is this the cat version of ""puppy blues""? Or am I just not fit to have a kitten at this stage of life?",0,"I resent my new kitten - true regret or ""kitten blues""?",text,514,"['resent', 'new', 'kitten', 'true', 'regret', 'kitten', 'blue', '21', 'recently', 'adopted', 'male', 'kitten', 'around', '56', 'month', 'old', '2', 'week', 'ago', 'context', 'neutered', 'caught', 'vaccination', 'basically', 'fell', 'love', 'say', 'volunteering', 'cat', 'rescue', 'several', 'time', 'week', 'seeing', 'course', 'couple', 'month', 'eventually', 'realized', 'would', 'sad', 'werent', 'greet', 'thought', 'could', 'handle', 'decided', 'adopt', 'encouragement', 'family', 'friendsi', 'really', 'happy', 'first', 'went', 'buying', 'toy', 'perch', 'thing', 'first', 'day', 'went', 'pretty', 'well', 'obviously', 'lot', 'adjustment', 'part', 'feeling', 'good', 'happy', 'companion', 'first', 'weekend', 'though', 'feel', 'like', 'ive', 'started', 'freak', 'feel', 'like', 'adoption', 'whim', 'panic', 'would', 'adopted', 'someone', 'else', 'im', 'worried', 'made', 'wrong', 'choicethe', 'kitten', 'kitten', 'climb', 'counter', 'eating', 'houseplant', 'tried', 'keep', 'high', 'sight', 'nontoxic', 'cat', 'ive', 'checked', 'already', 'waking', 'hour', 'night', 'scratching', 'knocking', 'thing', 'etc', 'expected', 'since', 'cat', 'growing', 'never', 'kitten', 'got', 'previous', 'cat', 'year', 'old', 'already', 'issue', 'though', 'bothering', 'expectedwhen', 'kitten', 'stove', 'fridge', 'tried', 'hide', 'houseplant', 'get', 'irritated', 'ever', 'cat', 'chewing', 'cable', 'chewing', 'plant', 'even', 'though', 'got', 'cat', 'grass', 'easily', 'accessible', 'make', 'meangry', 'im', 'frustrated', 'need', 'creature', 'suddenly', 'responsible', 'try', 'best', 'provide', 'still', 'cause', 'problem', 'know', 'thats', 'cat', 'brain', 'workbut', 'hard', 'change', 'come', 'across', 'human', 'thought', 'process', 'time', 'go', 'dislike', 'kitten', 'seems', 'feel', 'bad', 'hold', 'behavior', 'dont', 'know', 'let', 'go', 'know', 'cat', 'dont', 'respond', 'well', 'negative', 'reinforcement', 'hard', 'overcome', 'primal', 'urge', 'scream', 'see', 'jumping', 'curtain', 'thing', 'try', 'cuddle', 'dont', 'feel', 'better', 'feel', 'worse', 'want', 'leave', 'alone', 'pointso', 'frustration', 'normal', 'new', 'pet', 'owner', 'cat', 'version', 'puppy', 'blue', 'fit', 'kitten', 'stage', 'life']",resent new kitten true regret kitten blue  recently adopted male kitten around  month old  week ago context neutered caught vaccination basically fell love say volunteering rescue several time week seeing course couple month eventually realized would sad werent greet thought could handle decided adopt encouragement family friendsi really happy first went buying toy perch thing first day went pretty well obviously lot adjustment part feeling good happy companion first weekend though feel like ive started freak feel like adoption whim panic would adopted someone else im worried made wrong choicethe kitten kitten climb counter eating houseplant tried keep high sight nontoxic ive checked already waking hour night scratching knocking thing etc expected since growing never kitten got previous year old already issue though bothering expectedwhen kitten stove fridge tried hide houseplant get irritated ever chewing cable chewing plant even though got grass easily accessible make meangry im frustrated need creature suddenly responsible try best provide still cause problem know thats brain workbut hard change come across human thought process time go dislike kitten seems feel bad hold behavior dont know let go know dont respond well negative reinforcement hard overcome primal urge scream see jumping curtain thing try cuddle dont feel better feel worse want leave alone pointso frustration normal new pet owner version puppy blue fit kitten stage life

432,1668648081,self.CatAdvice,True,"We adopted two cats in a short amount of time. We first adopted a kitten that has a bit of CH in early September. Wanted to get him a playmate but was hoping to not get an aggressive kitten that could hurt him since he can't really jump away, climb stairs, and is less able to defend himself. Kitten is a very social, energetic, and sweet cat. Through a rescue, we adopted a 1.5 year old female cat who was described as super loving and super social. She was in a foster home with other cats, dogs, and lots of children around, and also super attentive to the kittens. She was found pregnant on the side of the road and was luckily rescued and gave birth at the foster home. She came to us in mid October.

When she first arrived, we kept the cats separate since neither were fixed, but started feeding them on either side of closed doors. It's been a few weeks since they've both been fixed and they've both recovered. They're able to eat on either side of a baby gate in full sight of each other with no issues. We started letting them in the same room together for short periods, and the kitten has learned to be wary of the older cat and not pounce as much because that'll get him swatted at. However, older cat will approach just to hiss at kitten. I'm worried that older cat will get territorial of the main floor of the house, which is the kitten's space and since he can't climb stairs, it's really his only space he can access without someone carrying him up or down. 

Is the hissing at kitten normal or is she being a bully? She'll relax in his presence and groom herself, but will also just hiss for no reason at all. Will they ever get past this stage and learn to play with each other or will she just maintain her distance from him always?

439,1668635764,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have 2 kittens, both coming up to 7 months old, one male one female. Both neutered and indoor only. They've got some ragdoll blood in them, if that info is important.

The female is 3kg and male is 3.5, weighed this morning before breakfast.

The female kitten has shown me she can self regulate, very occasionally leave a bit of food. The male one will clean his bowl to the point it looks washed and then go on to clean hers. Also meows for food when he sees me getting their bowl. 

I'm currently feeding them 300 calories give or take. 3 main meals of wet food, 1-2 snacks of wet food pouches shared between them, and dry food as treats before bed (5-6 varying meals a day). When they split food I gave the male one a bit more. 

I have conflicting info... The pouches say ~3-3.5 pouches for their age, which is ~240-280 kcals. But other websites (untamed list of kcal for kitten weight, not age) say ~400 kcal for 3.5kg. 

So I've got one source saying less than 300kcal for their AGE, another saying 400 for their WEIGHT...

I unfortunately don't trust my vet on this. I was feeding them 3 pouches a day with dry food when they were 6 months old and vet said my male kitten is on the heavier end of healthy. I trusted him and reduced dry food but he meowed more and was lethargic. So I did more research and based on the ""what does his waist look like"" diagram he's either underweight or lower end of health (could feel his ribs and spine easily, his shoulder blade was very obvious). So I feel I did him injustice and slowly went up to 300 kcal. But I'm not sure where to go from here... Do I stay 300 or go up to 350 gradually to 400?

440,1668633238,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all,

We just recently moved and my cat will not leave my girlfriend's office. We set it up as his home base, he's got a tree, a litter box, food and water. He's still eating and using the litter normally, and he's still playful and affectionate if you're in the room with him.

He doesn't seem to like the long hallway that connects to the room. I've tried putting another tree and a tunnel he loves in the hallway to give him some places to hide and make it smell familiar. Nothing seems to work. We've lived here since the 8th of October.

Any advice?

442,1668631295,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted my cat about 6 months ago from the shelter. When I got her, she was healthy and the shelter said she didn't have any health issues, besides a small cold which I was able to treat through some oral medicine. Since then though, I've had to take her to the vet multiple times for multiple different reasons. 

The most recent and severe vet visit was this week. Long story short, she was throwing up dozens of times (clear/foamy liquid). I've taken her to the vet 3 times this week. She was diagnosed with IBS/IBD/acute pancreatitis. She's currently at the vet as I am typing this, getting her iv fluids, medication, and steroids. 

I am currently struggling financially. I got in a car accident, have to find a new job due to being laid off, currently a college student, etc. 

I put away a few thousands of dollars incase my cat needed it for any emergencies or vet visits. But I've already spent it all within the past 6 months for her frequent vet visits. This week especially was a big dent as I got her an ultrasound, fluids, medication, shots, special food, all the vet fees, etc.

I don't know what to do. I am seriously thinking about surrendering her back to the shelter but I don't know. I live in Austin, Texas right now. I am feeling so guilty and stressed.

444,1668629119,self.CatAdvice,True,"In about a month, my cat and I will be moving into my parents house (who has a dog) for a few months. I would like some advise on how to introduce them. I know to start off with keeping them in separate rooms so they can get each others scent before actually meeting. But after that, I am not sure how to safely have them in the same room. 

For some background on my dog: she gets along with other dogs, she had been to pet hotels and is always fine being in the room with the dogs, but I am not sure how she is with cats. I know she can be territorial because we have seen her get aggressive toward humans (like my dog is very protective of me. If I am laying with my dog and my mom comes toward us, the dog will growl at my mom) So I am not sure if she will bring this side of her out on the cat, and if so, how do I prevent it?

And some background on the cat: she had been around other cats, and loves them. She is young and very playful, but she has never been around a dog before. My cat has never shown any signs of aggression. 

The house that we will be in is quite small, it has two bedrooms with an open kitchen/living room area. There is also a screened in porch. (I mention this because I am wondering if it would be a good idea to have one pet outside and one pet inside so they can see each other without being able to harm each other. But again, my dog is territorial, so I am not sure if that would make it even worse) Also, I think my cat might be a little bigger than my dog (my dog is a small white dog and my cat is a big black cat)

452,1668613430,self.CatAdvice,True,"Wondering if anyone else out there has a cat who is similar…

My partner and I have two brothers, born in our home in May 2020. They’re super sweet and well behaved. One is super fluffy and the other, the runt of the litter, has a short sleek coat. 

The runt has some personality quirks, and his most recent is kind of strange. He likes to hold “hands”, for one! He had always been better with water than his brother, licking the inside of the tub, and just general curiosity with the bath.

455,1668609163,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone!

I’m coming to the wonderful Reddit community today as I fear I’m going slightly insane and I could really do with some advice. Details below:

I grew up with cats, all of them with different personalities (as they tend to have) and I really missed having that fun feline companionship once I moved out almost 9 years ago. For years all I wanted was to have my own cat again and two months ago that dream finally became reality when my new landlord agreed that we (me and my partner of many years) could have one in our house. 

I immediately contacted our local shelter and told them that we would be more than happy to take on a more senior cat that might have been overlooked due to their age or looks before because none of that mattered very much to me, all I wanted was a little cuddle bug that would enjoy hanging out with me. Don’t get me wrong, cats are still cats and having grown up around them I am well aware that they don’t always want to be loved on and sometimes just wanna be left alone which, again, completely fine I just wanted a somewhat healthy, mostly affectionate little cat to call my own.

They were incredibly lovely and informed me that they had a great fit for us, an almost 10 year old little lady, that they told us whilst very shy at first, was also very affectionate. I was incredibly happy and a few days later we went to pick her up. Staff warned us that she wasn’t having a good day and was hiding in her igloo, but since we were warned that she was a timid cat ahead of time I didn’t let it bother me, I knew that she was just very scared. They told us that she came from a multi pet plus kids household where she hid for most of the day and would barely come out because she was very unsettled by all the goings on, hence why she was rehomed. We took her home that same day still.

She’s a very cute cat and after hiding for most of the day for the first few weeks she’s started to come out of her shell and will now sleep on the sofa or the bed instead of hiding somewhere in the house out of sight. She’s even super playful still and its very cute to watch.

Now my (would like to make it very clear that this is indeed a me problem, the cat is a cat and has obviously not done anything wrong) problem: 
She doesn’t like to be touched much or hang out with me. She will meow for attention in the mornings and evenings when she wants to be fed or wants someone to throw her toy around for her but won’t like it if you try and stroke her and evade. When trying to pet her when she’s sitting down she will gently swat at you or get up and leave so she clearly doesn’t enjoy it. She will also spend her time in a different room than me if she can and never really seeks company other than for meal times.

I’m really sad about it. The rational side of me knows that she’s just a cat and she doesn’t know any better but I just feel so heartbroken every time I look at her. I just want her to enjoy being with me, even if she never wants to be held or doted on loads I could live with that as long as she still at least enjoys being around me. But it doesn’t seem like she does, if anything she avoids me most of the time. I’ve tried being the one who feeds her, bonding over treats and playing. But she just doesn’t seem to have an much of an interest in interacting with me.

I feel like a horrible person because of how selfish I am being about this. I’ve been crying a lot because I feel like a terrible cat owner that can’t just accept that they have an independent cat and move on. My partner is getting frustrated with me being so upset about this as well and has told me that I need to stop being this emotional and that she’ll get around to liking me more eventually, but I feel like I’m getting nowhere. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Has anyone experienced something similar before and if so how did you make yourself get over yourself? How do I stop being so sad about not having the cuddly loving pet I wanted?

Again I know im being ridiculous and acting like a sensitive child, I just don’t know how to stop so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Note: I would never bring her back to the shelter regardless of my feelings. I made a commitment when I picked her that I would give her the best possible rest of her life I can and that commitment is unconditional.

458,1668604299,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all!

I have two cats. One is nearly two years, one is 3 months. 

The two year old has always had a problem waking me up excessively early. Honestly it’s on &amp; off. Over the past few months though (even before we got the little one) it has been excruciatingly bad. 

I make sure to play with them both before bed. They also get a small treat before bed, and throughout the day they are played with (we literally walk them) by us and each other. They are also very well fed. 

However, right around 4-5 am (our wake up time is 7) the older one starts. Meowing loudly, scratching at my face to wake my up, walking on my body, jumping on and off the bed. Now she’s teaching the little one this habit as well. 

I thought she needed more play time so I play with her even later. Nope, doesn’t work. I had hoped having the little one around would keep her occupied/distracted, but not really. 

We live in a studio-style apartment so there’s not really “another room” I can put her in. 

I have tried feeding her dinner later and later but that doesn’t seem to have any effect. 

I have tried just waiting up for 2-3 hours or holding off on feeding them for as long as I can, but I’m exhausted. I have a hard job &amp; a long commute and I haven’t had one night of solid sleep in so long. 

I don’t feed them dry food &amp; I worry about the logistics of a wet automatic feeder.

My parents have asked me to come stay with them this Christmas but I am a little worried about bringing my kitten on the train. 

She will have only had her 1st set of vaccinations at this point (due her booster on December 28th). The journey is 3 hours long and usually is a quiet journey. 

Also my parents have a cat but he is old and blind and does not go outside of there house (don’t think he’s been in contact with another cat for 2-4 years) and is also fully vaccinated. Their house is also big enough to keep the kitten and my parents cat completely separated if need be. 

Do you think this will be safe for the kitten as most advice I find says that as long as the kitten isn’t in contact with another unvaccinated cat it would be fine. 

I’m happy to stay in my own home this Christmas however my grandma is becoming quite unwell so I want to make the journey if I can. 

I do have a good carry case for the kitten and will be travelling with a friend also. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

TLDR: I know for a fact I will be a cat dad one day however my dilemma is whether I should get a cat now and perhaps later in life when I am much more stable and settled. 

My arguments AGAINST getting a cat now:
- I might be moving states or countries in the next year for better work opportunities, should I wait a few more years and settle down and then get a cat?
- I do not have my own car yet, I am worried that regular vet checkups might be a hassle without my own car, ofc I would not want to compromise on my cat’s health.

My arguments FOR getting a cat now:
- It would be awesome to have my own little goofball, I feel like it would be great for my mental health too, I often work remotely and it can get lonely at times.

Sorry for the long post but this is something that has been on my mind for a while now, I just wanted someone to reason with me on this and fellow cat mom/dads please feel free to drop advice on whether those challenges can be overlooked while adopting a cat.  
Please feel free to ask questions and share any similar experiences and what did you do?

468,1668574554,self.CatAdvice,True,"i have 2 cats who are only a couple months apart from one another. one is named jet (black cat) and the other is liam (tabby). they’re both a bit over 1 year old. 

jet was raised around different cats for a couple months, because i would always foster 1 additional kitten around his age. eventually, i stopped fostering for a bit and went back to it later (we were fostering liam and ended up adopting him).

initially, they didn’t like each other, but after slow introductions they have grown to be a bonded pair. they play together, groom one another, cuddle together, etc. 

liam is very affectionate. he follows me around, needs constant attention from me, won’t let me use the bathroom alone. yk, typical clingy cat stuff.

jet USED to be very affectionate, as a kitten. i know it’s typical for them to become less affectionate during adolescence and adulthood, but i think this is different. 

jet has grown to run away whenever he sees me step in his direction. his tail is always low- not between his legs, but low. it is either like “ / “ or it is slightly curled at the base of his tail, angled downward with a hook at the tip of his tail. he walks around the house with his tail in this position all the time. i would insert a picture but i rarely use reddit and don’t know how to do that lol. he isn’t scared to be in my vicinity, but he does not like me approaching him, even if i do so slowly. he sleeps on my bed occasionally, and lets me scratch his chin every once and a while. he rarely lays with his stomach exposed and loafs a LOT.

he generally doesn’t like being touched, but i am the one who typically has to chase him around cut his nails, give him eyedrops (he has issues with his left eye), and sometimes have to pull him out from under something to do so. and i obviously have to hold him which he doesn’t enjoy. 

he used to petting him and holding him, but he’s taken a complete 180 and i don’t know if i’ve traumatized him or what. he doesn’t mind playing with me today

i don’t mind if he turns out to be a less affectionate cat with age, but i wish he would stop running from me and such. i don’t know if i did something wrong or if maybe having another cat may be upsetting to him for some reason even though they get along really well?

anything would help, i just want him to feel safe at home :(",0,my cat’s tail is always down,text,449,"['cat', 'tail', 'always', '2', 'cat', 'couple', 'month', 'apart', 'one', 'another', 'one', 'named', 'jet', 'black', 'cat', 'liam', 'tabby', 'bit', '1', 'year', 'old', 'jet', 'raised', 'around', 'different', 'cat', 'couple', 'month', 'would', 'always', 'foster', '1', 'additional', 'kitten', 'around', 'age', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'fostering', 'bit', 'went', 'back', 'later', 'fostering', 'liam', 'ended', 'adopting', 'himinitially', 'like', 'slow', 'introduction', 'grown', 'bonded', 'pair', 'play', 'together', 'groom', 'one', 'another', 'cuddle', 'together', 'etc', 'liam', 'affectionate', 'follows', 'around', 'need', 'constant', 'attention', 'let', 'use', 'bathroom', 'alone', 'yk', 'typical', 'clingy', 'cat', 'stuffjet', 'used', 'affectionate', 'kitten', 'know', 'typical', 'become', 'le', 'affectionate', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'think', 'different', 'jet', 'grown', 'run', 'away', 'whenever', 'see', 'step', 'direction', 'tail', 'always', 'low', 'leg', 'low', 'either', 'like', 'slightly', 'curled', 'base', 'tail', 'angled', 'downward', 'hook', 'tip', 'tail', 'walk', 'around', 'house', 'tail', 'position', 'time', 'would', 'insert', 'picture', 'rarely', 'use', 'reddit', 'know', 'lol', 'scared', 'vicinity', 'like', 'approaching', 'even', 'slowly', 'sleep', 'bed', 'occasionally', 'let', 'scratch', 'chin', 'every', 'rarely', 'lay', 'stomach', 'exposed', 'loaf', 'lothe', 'generally', 'like', 'touched', 'one', 'typically', 'chase', 'around', 'cut', 'nail', 'give', 'eyedrop', 'issue', 'left', 'eye', 'sometimes', 'pull', 'something', 'obviously', 'hold', 'enjoy', 'used', 'petting', 'holding', 'taken', 'complete', '180', 'know', 'traumatized', 'mind', 'playing', 'todayi', 'mind', 'turn', 'le', 'affectionate', 'cat', 'age', 'wish', 'would', 'stop', 'running', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'another', 'cat', 'may', 'upsetting', 'reason', 'even', 'though', 'get', 'along', 'really', 'wellanything', 'would', 'help', 'want', 'feel', 'safe', 'home', '']",tail always  couple month apart one another one named jet black liam tabby bit  year old jet raised around different couple month would always foster  additional kitten around age eventually stopped fostering bit went back later fostering liam ended adopting himinitially like slow introduction grown bonded pair play together groom one another cuddle together etc liam affectionate follows around need constant attention let use bathroom alone yk typical clingy stuffjet used affectionate kitten know typical become le affectionate adolescence adulthood think different jet grown run away whenever see step direction tail always low leg low either like slightly curled base tail angled downward hook tip tail walk around house tail position time would insert picture rarely use reddit know lol scared vicinity like approaching even slowly sleep bed occasionally let scratch chin every rarely lay stomach exposed loaf lothe generally like touched one typically chase around cut nail give eyedrop issue left eye sometimes pull something obviously hold enjoy used petting holding taken complete  know traumatized mind playing todayi mind turn le affectionate age wish would stop running know something wrong maybe another may upsetting reason even though get along really wellanything would help want feel safe home

Over 2 years, I’ve managed with getting her to show herself during the daytime now and she will cuddle with me sleeping at night. Huge accomplishments.

But, I moved out of my tiny apartment in with my boyfriend into a fairly large house. I’ve been keeping her in a spare bedroom for now, with everything she needs, until she feels more relaxed to explore the house. However I anticipate she will just freak out, and search for obscure places to hide which is what she does best.

I’m wondering how long it will take her to adjust, how long I should keep her confined to one room, and anything else I can do to get her to be less scared.

I got Prozac from the Vet but the first few times of administering were traumatizing for her in itself that I stopped.

485,1668556339,self.CatAdvice,True,"I dont want to get into too much detail, but my partner and I have two cats - a tabby who is almost a year and a half old and a Russian blue mix who is about nine months old. The tabby is completely fine with having her nails cut, all she needs is one of us scratching her chin and she rolls all fours up and let's you do whatever you want.

The Russian blue is a lot less accepting - he was fine up until the last couple of months, but now when you hold his paws at all he flinches and tries to bite as soon as he sees the clippers near him. It's not pain in his paws I don't think, as he still scratches on scratchers frequently and jumps up and down from counters and the cat trees with ease.

I'm convinced that it's my partner's anxiety rubbing off on him after watching Jackson Galaxy for a long time, I usually hold him (gently) in my lap and scratch his ears and she goes for his nails, doing one or two at a time, but now when he moves or wiggles at all, my partner pulls her hand back and gasps. It's gone from that to snapping and trying to bite. We can't trade spots, as now im sure if she was on ""holding"" duty I'd get bit when she gets anxious.

Are there any suggestions beyond what I've already seen online? Its very challenging to try and do anything with him without holding him, and I can't hold him and do his nails at the same time.

486,1668556244,self.CatAdvice,True,"So, my cat’s dry food got discontinued a week before we leave him for our 3-day Thanksgiving trip!! I am freaking out a little. He was on a low quality dry food (Meow Mix Gravy-coated) supplemented with FF wet food and I planned to transition him to a better dry food after our trip. 

Anyways, we were running out of his usual dry food so I went to the grocery store and…  it’s not there. Ensue panic. It isn’t available on Amazon except for some overpriced third party sellers. Not available in any store near me. So I go to Petsmart, spend an hour on my phone looking up brands, and finally buy Hills Science Diet Urinary &amp; Hairball Control Adult Dry. 

The reason I got Urinary is because he got diagnosed with FIC last month, he’s a 1.5yo neutered indoor male cat, I really liked that it’s formulated specifically for urinary health. I’m also nervous that the diet change AND us leaving could trigger a FIC episode. I installed a Feliway diffuser today…

I gave him some pieces of his new expensive kibble, he gave it a strong try and ate some, then spit one out. The pieces are bigger and softer than his old kibble. Then I mixed in less than 1/4 into his old food, he hasn’t tried it yet but to be fair he mostly eats his dry food at night when I’m asleep. What are the chances of this transition working within the next week?? Should I have tried to transition him to a similar Meow Mix food (maybe Tender Centers or Original)?

495,1668542947,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two 5-month old kittens. It has been a struggle finding food they like, they are both very picky even though they were strays living by a dumpster until I took them in. 

One of them seems to love a specific brand of kitten dry food, which is great. The other one doesn't mind it, but he seems to grow bored after a while and won't continue eating it later in the day. He has reacted like this to every dry food I have tried, so I think he's just not a fan of dry food in general.  

I recently discovered that he loves wet pate food. The only problem is I can't find any wet food for kittens, even the non-pate kind. I have checked every single supermarket and pet store in the city. 

I have looked online, and there's some (but not much), and the prices are double and triple what the prices are for adult food in the local stores. Also, there's no Amazon here so the shipping prices are pretty bad.

499,1668536871,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two cats, one aged 11 (Max) who is very long and slim and looks healthy (12lbs), and one aged 9 (Oreo) who has always been small but chunky. Recently Oreo has been gaining weight and is now an astonishing 16lbs. I feel awful that I let it go on that long but we were going through an incredibly stressful time and just didn't notice because she often hides. She seems otherwise healthy. We've always been able to leave out the food and the cats have regulated how much they need to eat, but over time we've realized that Oreo is a snacker and she keeps coming back for more food. We're trying to figure out how to help her lose weight, and how to set out the food so both cats are eating an appropriate amount. We've tried 2x/day feedings by separating the cats and by putting one dish up high where the other can't reach. Neither of those options have worked- maybe they are just so used to having access to food all day and are confused. I thought Oreo would come running every morning when I fill the dish but she doesn't come until close to the time I have to leave for work, so she doesn't eat much.

501,1668534374,self.CatAdvice,True,"sorry for the long read. there’s nothing i can do now so it’s more of a rant. 

we are being forced to leave the country due to some immigration issues - i won’t go into it but it’ll be 2 to 3 months depending on if our visa renewal is approved quick. 

i’ve already been stressing out on missing months of school and life in general, but now, the night before we leave, i’m starting to worry about our 2 cats. 

our only real choice is to keep them in this house. all the airlines to our destination will only ship the cats as cargo (not even necessarily on the same plane). nearby boarding facilities have come back to us saying they can’t keep them for such a long time. my parents told me to find one of my friends to catsit for us, and there was literally only one that was willing to do it.

the problem is, she’s really busy and it wouldn’t be fair for her to come out to the middle of nowhere (we live in the middle of nowhere) every day, so my parents told her every other day. i’m scared this isn’t often enough. 

the plan is my friend will come every other day and refill food bowls that we’ve put all over the house, and change the water too. 

only one of the cats is fond of playing, and my friend is free to use any of the cat toys lying around (we also have some toys that the cats can play with without assistance). 

the cats have already met her and though they aren’t in love, they don’t mind her. they’re good with rationing food and aren’t big drinkers. 

i still think it’s concerning to only have a person come once every two days - i have been bringing up the option of finding someone else to fill the gaps, but my mother shut me down and said it was fine and the cats would be okay. we also have the common problem of money (plane tickets are very expensive). 

i’m just so scared, but now it’s just too late to do anything. i have other friends that can maybe come visit every so often, but this is the only person who lives close enough to come on a regular basis, my other friends all live 2 hours away with public transport.

My concern comes in with his meowing. He only aims these meows at me, he doesn't go to or meow at my wife even though she plays with him and feeds him too, I think its because the kitten knows she won't respond. We are both at home 24/7, I tend to respond because I'm worried that he's bored.

He gets colder than my other animals every fall/winter so I have multiple heating pads laid out in his favorite spots, including my bed. But sometimes he just likes a good cuddle against my core under the blankets at night. And so do I! But, because of his condition, I worry about his actual limitations versus most cats limitations. I have a relatively light, fluffy blanket at the moment but as we get deeper into the winter I will be incorporating something thicker (or doubling up). I'm an experienced cat owner and I know that many bed worries about cats are solved by the cats themselves (i.e. what if I roll over onto them? what if they get too hot/cold? Etc) but I'm concerned that my cat's disability could somehow limit his oxygen under any blanket but especially a good winter one. He often completely submerges himself, head and all, under the blanket and he has gotten up and wobbled himself out once he seemed to feel warm enough.

517,1668492064,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a 3 1/2 year old cat who I raised primarily through quarantine (got him only a couple months before COVID hit). He's lived the majority of his life so far with me and my 3 other roommates while I was in school. In June of this year I graduated and moved back home with him and a couple weeks after the move he started vomiting a lot. During this period of about 2 weeks he vomited almost once a day if not more and couldn't really keep any food down. Took him to the vet and he had a small fever and they kept him overnight on an IV, gave him antibiotics, blood tests, and x-rays. While there he had no problems keeping food down and nothing was found on the blood tests or x-rays. The fever went away after his stay overnight and I was able to take him home with some medicine to sprinkle on his food for the following 2 weeks. 

Flash forward about 2 and a half months later and he starts vomiting again. Not nearly as much or intensely as the first time but still regularly enough for it to cause concern. I take him back to the vet and they say everything about him is healthy other than that he is a bit underweight ( He's been sitting at 8 lbs ever since July and he's usually 10). They give me deworming meds just in case + some probiotic powder for his food and sent him home. After that he doesn't vomit for about a month and a half but isn't really gaining back any weight. Then about a week ago he began vomiting again about every other day. 

During this time my family and I have tried wet food, single ingredient foods, expensive kibble, kibble for sensitive cats, grain-free kibble, and nothing has been able to stop him from vomiting. He really misses kibble even though most of the time that seems to trigger the vomit and he won't eat that much of his wet food. I've scheduled another vet appointment but I'm honestly so confused on what's been happening to him. 

Some other key things:

\- He never had anything like this happen in the 3 years I've had him BEFORE we moved this summer

\- Throughout all of this I haven't found any blood in any of his pee, poop, or vomit

\- He has the same levels of energy and acts completely normal after/between vomiting. Whenever he gets his daily zoomies he literally runs laps around the house

But yeah not sure if its a psychological thing, like the move stressed him out and now he has a really sensitive stomach? Or if it's something way more serious.

519,1668486156,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have 2 sibling cats. A very outgoing male and a shy calico. The calico is very cuddly and a tad possessive with me though. I just went through a very rough period with her, where she would tinkle in the bed, sometimes even straight on me while I was sleeping.  

I tried the scientific approach: changing each variable in isolation. Needless to say, I did A LOT of laundry over the last couple of weeks.

Steps:
(1) Checked for medical problems.
(2) Then I thought she was hungry at night and was trying to wake me up for food. So I bought automatic feeders.
(3) Took the roof of the litter boxes
(4) Put additional litter boxes
(5) changed the location of the litter boxes

All of this was to no avail until:

(6) I changed the (expensive) litter with cheap ass litter and the problem disappeared just like that. Problem solved...

Last weekend I had some company overnight. My love life is such that this is a very rare occasion, so the cats are not used to that 😄 We were sitting on the sofa and calico looked desperate to be involved: she saw me, my companion and her brother all sitting together, but was too scared and shy to come closer. You could see the panic in her face. She was finally brave enough to come stand on the sofa with us, where she quietly tinkled and left. We didn't even notice until half hour later.

When I found out, I gave her extra attention and treats and reassured her it's ok to have an accident. You can't imagine the purrs she gave me. I'd like to think I reassured her that she is still my number 1 girl :) Luckily this was a one-off and she resumed standard litter box duties right away.

526,1668478637,self.CatAdvice,True,"Help! On October 28th, I adopted a one-year-old female cat. The foster parents (that she spent about 9 months with in their apartment with three other cats) said she's a very chill and friendly. After taking her home to my apartment (keeping her in the bedroom), she would NOT come out from under the bed. It took her three days to start eating and drinking and using the litter box. We are now nearing the end of week 3, and her behavior is so interesting to me. She only comes out at night (unless I'm not home - I have cameras set up to watch her) and she lets me pet her while I'm laying in bed. She uses the cat tree I got her, sits in the window, and even plays with some toys; however, as soon as the sun rises or if she notices I'm awake, she goes RIGHT back underneath the bed and will not come out. It's like she's totally afraid of me and I can't get near her during the day, even though she lets me pet her and lay with her at night. Almost as if she thinks I'm a completely different entity during the day. I've tried playing with her, laying on the floor and talking to her, blocking off the bed (but she keeps finding ways under there), giving her treats - nothing.

528,1668474189,self.CatAdvice,True,"The reason might be obvious, he was home alone for two weeks and my cousin would feed him and clean his litter everyday, would play too but rarely. So he probably has a lot of energy that he hasn’t used. We are back now for good and his behaviour has changed. 
Before this he used to come sleep next to me on his own and sometimes at night he would bite my arm but kinda gently. But now he yowls in the middle of the night and I have to come get him to bed. And then he lunges and attacks to “capture my arm” to bite  (really hard). (All while purring) He did it several times and I had to put him out of the room. 
I’ve been playing with him more to fix this but it doesn’t seem to work. He also attacks the stick of the cat toy than the toy itself.

My boyfriend and I live in an apartment with her. 
She experiences what seems in my opinion to be severe boredom.

She is spayed. She is up to date with the vet and no medical concerns.

We have several toys for her, but she just stares at them when I try to play with her. However, if I do nothing, she also just meows repeatedly for attention.

This is combined with her meowing because my boyfriend is about to be home and she’s excited. Unfortunately, I work from home and this is making things frustrating.

Finally, she begs for food and meows around her dinner time. After her dinner, my boyfriend is about to arrive home. So for about two hours straight every afternoon I am tortured. 
She also does it early in the morning when she’s awake and excited, and so unfortunately I don’t sleep very well.

Oh and we tried to get another cat. She hated the kitten and was territorial. So that’s out too.

She never scratched or bit me when I approach her in that state and I pet her to make sure its all fine. Whats weird too is that when I sit down on the couch she comes up to me and sits on my lap, even if i remove her she comes back on it again, so i don't understand why she is anxious in other situations.

535,1668460476,self.CatAdvice,True,"5 weeks ago we adopted a 2.5 year old female who when we got her home, was INCREDIBLY stressed. She wouldn’t sleep, wouldn’t stop pacing, had blood in her stool from stress. Eventually she was put on 100mg of gabapentin daily which helped but now she’s settling in, she’s becoming aggressive with my partner and I.

When we met her in the shelter, they told us she was shy at first but loves people and is happy around other cats. That was it. Yesterday we emailed the shelter who advised they knew about these behaviours and actually had her on 200mg of gabapentin a day to keep her relaxed. We weren’t told any of this, we weren’t even sent home with any medications for her. They then told us that we are unable to return her if it’s not a good fit and it’ll be classified as a surrender which we will have to pay for. I was furious and distraught that this information was withheld from us.

We’re relatively new cat parents and we don’t have the experience to modify these behaviours, let alone try to do so without being told the extent of it from the beginning. We don’t want to give up on her and we’re taking her to our own vet tomorrow morning to see what they say but I feel AWFUL. She deserves a home that can give her the time and patience she deserves. 

We also told the shelter with Christmas coming up we will have family around (including young kids) and their solution was ‘put her in a room’. Which granted, we would likely have to do anyway because she cannot be around new people in a scenario like that but they felt so unsupportive.

540,1668451645,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello everyone! First time poster here, apologies if I need to edit this in any way

I adopted a 6 (now 7 month) kitten about a month ago. She is adorable, but she seems to be bored no matter what I do. She’s started displaying behavioral issues like biting hands/feet and biting and scratching furniture. We have many scratching posts, but I think she’s learned that scratching and biting furniture=someone is going to pull her away and give her attention, so she continues to bite and scratch them. I’m going to try double sided tape to get her to stop that. But the bigger issue is her biting. I know that when a kitten bites it means they are bored, so whenever she does that I try to play with her, but she often times ignores the toys I try to use and keeps going for hands and feet! I have multiple dangly toys (stuffed things attached to a stick with a string, unsure what the correct name is) a few catnip filled stuff toys that I throw for her to chase, as well as a motion activated toy and some noisy balls on a track that she likes to bat around. Sometimes dangling or throwing something works, but a lot of times she seems barely interested in it, she’ll lay on her back and bat it around a little and then get bored and try to attack our hands and feet again. I know she likes these toys, because sometimes we get a great session in and she really leaps for it and wears herself out, but a lot of time nothing I do gets her interested in playing with anything but our flesh. 

I’m really not sure what I’m doing wrong here. I had a cat my entire childhood but she was a lazy rag doll, I’m clearly a bit out of my depth with a tortie kitten. It’s started to become a genuine issue, potentially damaging my nice furniture is bad enough, but I don’t know how to work from home when she demands constant attention yet doesn’t care for playing with anything but my hands and feet!

541,1668450266,self.CatAdvice,True,"First things first, she's 7 months old and yes she hasn't been spayed yet. Her spay appointment was on 8th November but it was postponed to 6th December. She is currently on her second heat and literally peeing on everything that's made of fabric. Not spraying, just urinating normally by squatting. I have tried my best to clean up after her using enzyme cleaners but she just keeps peeing anyway. She does pee in the litter box when I put her manually and I do keep the litter box clean.

She actually had that habit of peeing outside her litter box since I adopted her at 3 months old but it wasn't as frequent. Anytime she saw any clothing on the bed(even a blanket) or on the floor, she'd pee on it. We managed to get it under control by moving the blankets and clothes from the bed immediately after we're done though she still peed on the couch sometimes. She also has a habit of holding her pee in as long as she can. I heard UTIs could also be the cause and talked to the vet about it but she ruled it out.

So now on top of her constant yowling and screaming combined with the frequent peeing habit is driving everyone nuts. I love her to death but I cannot keep cleaning after her multiple times every single day. 

Will spaying get rid of this peeing problem? I heard the longer a cat is allowed to pee like that during heat, the harder it is to get rid of this habit even after spaying. Her appointment is still 3 weeks away and that means there'll be another heat after the current one which means more peeing if she hasn't developed the habit already. I'm so stressed out.

I live in a small one bed apartment - I have a single cat, she’s about 2 years old. She’s friendly and quite attached to me but she’s equally friendly and curious when people come over. 

I’ve been on vacations since I got her, and so far my bf crashes at mine to look after her which means she’s had no changes to her routine. Recently I’ve been sleeping over at my bfs from time to time but still making sure her feeding schedule is undisturbed (to get her used to spending nights alone). She’s been fine with that too

My question is, I’m comfortable leaving her with drop in visits from a sitter (once or twice a day) if I go away for 2-4 days. But have you guys left your cat at home with only drop in visits for about 30 min for 2 weeks at a time? I could also drop her off at boarders I’ve found on Rover but idk what the better option is since I’ve heard cats prefer to stay in their space. But I’m worried that she’ll get lonely all by herself for that long.

548,1668431063,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone!

My BF and I have a cat together and we will be going on a two-week vacation overseas soon. It will be the first time he will be away from home for so long and consequently the first time the cat will be staying at a friend’s flat.

Besides the basics (litter box, litter, and food) this is what we are planning on taking with her to our friend’s flat:
- her blanket
- one blanket we have on the sofa that has our smell
- one of my t-shirts and one of my bf’s T-Shirt
- two of her favourite toys
- treats
- her cat grass
- the basket she sleeps in during the day
- a scratching post

Is there anything else we could take with her that would make her stay more comfortable?

I’m also worried about the timing of taking her over to our friend’s flat. My instinct is to have her as long as possible with us and only take her there as the last thing. But I think it might end up being too stressful for everyone involved. My BF is of the same opinion and suggested taking her there ca. 48h before our flight, so we can even stay there a bit for her to settle in. What would be best?

552,1668402716,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have two cats, a first for me, I've always had only one. They are roughly a year apart and have been together since I adopted the youngest at eight weeks. They sleep together, groom each other, eat side by side, and other than one particular spot on the cat tower aren't territorial.

I went away this weekend, from Friday to Sunday. They had automatic feeders and my sister checked on them Saturday (I've since checked, she said they were behaving normally). I got home this evening, they didn't come greet me at the door. First I found the older one, then the younger one came in the room but they started hissing at each other. The younger one was also soaking wet (I think they fought near the water bowl as there was a huge puddle), had scratches and was acting terrified while the older one was puffing up and acting like he'd never seen the younger one in his life.

I know this can happen when cats are separated, say a vet visit or something but it has never happened with them after a vet visit or in the rate occasion the older one gets out the house. There was nothing that would have changed how they smelled or seemed to each other. Just my absence and I've left for the weekend before. 

They've been separated since I've been home, the baby mostly with me since he was the most shaken up, though he seems much calmer now. They ate on each a side of a door for dinner. But the older one saw me moving the baby (we were rotating rooms so everyone was set up for the night but isolated rather than their usual run of the house) and he puffed up and started hissing again.

553,1668400469,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone, I hope this type of post is allowed. I'm not asking for medical advice or anything, I am just frustrated and need advice from other cat owners. My roommate has a cat and she is the sweetest cat ever. This past summer we moved into an apartment and the cat began peeing all over the stairs. This was extremely abnormal since she never did this in our old apartment and is often well behaved and relaxed. I know the peeing outside of the litter box can be caused by stress from the new environment, plus my roommate has been extremely inconsistent with cleaning the litter box. I made it very clear that I am worried about the cat, the unclean litter box's impact on the cat, the damages to the stairs, and that the cat pee smell is completely unbearable. Everyone that I bring over makes comments about the smell and my friends who are cat owners tell me that the smell will most likely never come out. Due to this, we had to get the carpet torn out of the stairs. The peeing stopped for a bit but then started again, except this time on the wood that was under the carpet. I begged my roommate to take her to the vet or find remedies to help the cat to stop peeing on the stairs. My roommate then buys some UTI medicine online and says that's the most she can do. Also, I forgot to mention that we have tried every form of cleaner to get the cat pee out. It doesn't get rid of the smell, but it does conceal it for a day or two. With all of this being said, I am so stressed. I have tried everything to make it clear to my roommate that this cat needs medical attention and the cat pee smell is spreading all over the apartment. She responds by saying that she's doing everything she can and she is already dealing with too much in regards to schoolwork. I am so tired of worrying about this.

555,1668396042,self.CatAdvice,True,"So my fiancé &amp; I live in a small one bedroom apartment and we recently got a kitten whom we love absolutely dearly. The entrance to our unit has a tiny hallway that leads to the other three units on our floor. We opened up our front door to get some mail one day, and he curiously wandered out into the hallway. The hallway is closed off by doors and theres no way for him to escape so we let him sniff around and explore for a couple minutes then brought him back inside in our unit. Ever since then, he will sit at the front door and cry and meow and it seems as though he wants to go back out to the hallway. I try to distract him with toys, treats, anything. But after a couple minutes he’ll just go back to crying at the door. It gets quite frustrating hearing him yell at us for hours on end. I’m nervous if I let him back out there, i’m encouraging the behavior that crying at door=getting what he wants. I don’t know if that makes me sound like a bad cat mom but I am just not a fan of him being out in that hallway in case another tenant walks in and they get upset or my cat runs out the building once they open the outside door.

556,1668395819,self.CatAdvice,True,"We adopted two bonded cats last week and we are worried they aren’t bonded at all. The humane society (Toronto based shelter rescue) assessed these two cats and concluded that they are bonded so we were excited to take both home. 

One is female, 3 years old. Spayed. The other is a boy, 2 years old and neutered recently. 

They seem fine on their own, super affectionate with us, playful, not stressed at all. Eating well, drinking lots of water. Beyond that though, they seem to avoid each other. He’s fairly indifferent to her but she actively dislikes him any time he’s near her. She will growl, hiss and swat at him if he gets close. Him being younger and full of bouncy energy, and our place being a condo, this causes issues. 

We don’t have any experience with bonded cats so we don’t know if this is going to change as they get more comfortable. We also don’t know if we should trust the assessment of the place we got them from. They’ve been radio silent on the concerns we have posed to them and are not calling us back.

My biggest concern is we live in a 700sq foot condo in the city. There is enough room here for them to avoid each other and have their space but keeping two unbonded cats in a space this small for the next decade or more seems unfair to them.

So the tittle is pretty self-explanatory but I have a dog and some other family members in my house, we’re still sorting out the finer details of me getting my own kitten to take care of but I was wondering if I should be worried about protecting my pc cables since I’ve heard kittens will chew through cords especially but wasn’t too sure on how to protect cords/wiring!

I’ve done a lot of research otherwise and I volunteer at a shelter which I’ve done work with cats/kittens so I’m pretty well versed with all types of animals in general and behaviours etc so I’m not too worried about that, in case anyone was wondering :)


Another thing that I’d like to ask about with a litter box, if I’m keeping the litter box in my room for bare minimum a few weeks or even months depending on how the kitten adjusts to the change, is there anyway to make sure the litter doesn’t totally stink up my room? 

I’ve heard good things about pine pellets and a sifter litter but wasn’t too sure if a basic clay clump based litter would do the trick for a relatively small bedroom!

560,1668391232,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a 3 year old female cat that I adopted a few months ago. she's super sweet and affectionate until I try to give her any kind of treat. I want to be able to use treats as positive enforcement for when she does things I like, but it's too scary right now! 

when she sees that I have treats, she begins huffing and hissing and her eyes get huge and she lunges at me whenever I get my hand close enough to give her a treat. she often bites my hand as I try to offer her a treat. what's weird about this is that she does not exhibit this behavior with her regular food (which she does seem to love since she's very prompt about demanding her food and gets very excited when I'm filling her bowl) to the point where I can take food out of the bowl while she's eating and she doesn't even blink.

she was a stray and I imagine that that's why she has some food aggression - I just can't tell how to solve this. if I withhold a treat because she bit me she gets really agitated, but hardly any less agitated as she is after she eats one treat and expects another. honestly it scares me to give her treats because of how aggressive she can get.

But basically I had two cats since kittens I didn't really want but took them on and started  to tolerate them as qthey grew older. I was dating someone that suddenly passed away with two mature cats.. They were barely warming up to me while I was there. She didn't have many friends and the ones that were there didn't want them, her parents were talking about euthanasia. I didn't want them separated and I decided to take them on because they were her life and I wanted her to live on with them and be taken care of. Only issue is I live in a small 1 bedroom 667sqft condo. They get along with my cats, not so much me. I'm trying to comfort them as much as I can at a distance with food and treats at every corner. My two cats have been overly energetic running around, eating their food so I can't make sure how much her cats getting. My cats have been extra cuddly and snuggly especially at bed I guess to protect me. But also when I scold my cats they'll run behind hers for protection as ill probably get swatted. I'm trying to at least get them all in the same littler box and food but hers are mature. Her cats were on some low grade frisskies with food like mine but they can't tolerate it anymore. I've just been giving it to them as comfort and make sure they eat. They were on friskie kibble while mine are on a grain free salmon diet. Is there any way I can transition them to eating the same thing? What kind of feeders or litter boxes would you suggest? I'm thinking of self feeders and a self cleaner.

563,1668387332,self.CatAdvice,True,"We have two cats: Trisk (2 years, former stray adopted at 1 year) and Banshee (8mo, adopted from my partner's boss because she wasn't working for their home). Both are spayed. We took Banshee in because Trisk seems like she would benefit from some feline company, and Banshee was causing some behavioral problems when left alone during the day. We had hoped that Banshee would be a good playmate for Trisk, and Trisk would keep Banshee company when there weren't any humans in the house.

We brought her home about 3 weeks ago, and we have our house partitioned off into two sides using baby gates with a thick blanket draped over them. We unfortunately don't have any doors, as we live in a trailer. Trisk and Banshee have had minimal contact through the baby gate, and Trisk seems fine with Banshee, but Banshee is showing a lot of aggression towards Trisk. We regularly have to redirect her from trying to claw and growl at the baby gate, and over the past few days she's learned how to knock it over. Every time she does, she goes for Trisk, hissing and snarling. Trisk seems more confused than anything, and just runs to a safer spot and stares at her instead of trying to fight back. We always separate them as soon as we can when this happens, but Banshee has mauled my hand a few times now for that, and I don't know how to get her to understand that Trisk isn't a threat and leave her alone.

Trisk has met plenty of other cats from her time before we adopted her, as she was part of the local cat colony. She also adored our 18yo cat that we no longer have. Banshee, as far as I know, hasn't met any other cats besides her parents/siblings, but she loves dogs and people, and actively enjoys being picked up except when she's being aggressive towards Trisk. I've seen a lot of people recommend food rewards for being calm towards the other cat, but we haven't found any treats that Banshee is interested in. Neither cat is food aggressive, and they're fed on opposite sides of the house.

At this point, my partner and I plan on building a temporary door so that Banshee can no longer knock over the baby gates. However, that doesn't help the fact that she still seems to hate Trisk. Is there anything we can do to calm her down?

569,1668379942,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey! I’m wondering if y’all can help me with this dilemma I’ve been having. I adopted my cat two years ago from a Humane Society (she’s about 3.5 to 4 now, a short haired brown tabby). She was a stray for the first year of her life and heavily pregnant. When she was finally taken in, she was able to give birth safely and fostered for a few months before going to the Humane Society, where I found her. 

I first adopted her in a house in college, with four other girls, then moved to a house in a city with two of the same girls.  If it’s important, it was a year each in both of those houses. Unfortunately, because of the ruckus of city life (and we lived on busy streets), I was not able to let her go outside. 

I moved into a house with my boyfriend 2 months ago in a very quiet neighborhood, but the thing is there is a pack of coyotes that live in the area that are known to steal and kill cats. I would love to make her an indoor/outdoor cat but I just don’t want to lose her to the coyotes outside. We have seen them multiple times in the neighborhood and many times 50 feet in front of our house. We also plan to be here for a few years, if not longer, so she won’t be moved around any time soon.

My dilemma is that she’s constantly wanting to be outside, more so than the other two houses she was in. She’s scratching at the door, she’s scratching at windows, dramatically meowing all the time and leading us to the doors. I try to put her on the leash and walk her outside on it so she can get some outdoor time, but I can’t do it all the time every day like she wants. 

She also just sits there in the grass and eats the grass or sits on the sidewalk and just watches the birds. She has full access to all the windows in the house, where she just watching the birds and outside. I took her outside today, and it was the first time she came across the other neighborhood cat. The other cat was fine, just seemed a bit curious. She, however, puffed up, and started hissing, and was really apprehensive. She’s usually fine with other cats, mostly apathetic, but this time she was a real jerk. 

I asked the neighbor how he handles his cat being outside, and he said he’s had no problem with it. He tends to stay around the house and even chases off certain raccoons.

We have plenty of toys for her we constantly love and pet and play with her, but for some reason she just can’t let go of being outside. Any advice what to do?

571,1668377256,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi guys,

So I have two cats (1 year old M and 10 month old F). They have been living together for almost a year now. We did slow and proper introductions and they were great together (still are, for the most part). My male cat has always been super playful and rambunctious, my female cat is more chill and quiet. Over the past 2 months, my male cat has been playing rough with my female cat, he's been hunting her and chasing her to the point where she will hiss and hide. However, they share food and cuddle and lick each other all the time too, so it's pretty confusing.

They have never gotten into a full on fight (i.e. no blood drawn and my male cat will usually back away) BUT over the past 2 weeks my female cat has pooped 3 times under the couch/my bed, depending. I think it's related to this hunting behaviour my male cat has been doing (maybe she is afraid to use the box?) This has never ever been an issue before and i'm just not sure what to do. For context, the litter boxes are covered and they have never been an issue. I have two litter boxes and they are far apart in my apartment in quiet areas. I am taking my female cat to the vet to rule out medical issues, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips (I rent an apartment, so I can't unfortunately add too many options for climbing/more levels, but they have two cat trees).

576,1668371675,self.CatAdvice,True,"**DIsclaimer: I am not looking for medical advice. We have a vet to discuss medications with, who has given an accurate diagnosis.**

---

My heart breaks writing this.

I have three cats, all indoors only. In 2018, when two of the cats were 8(Female) and 7(Male), we adopted an 8 week old kitten(Male). No one at the adoption agency consulted us about the age gap between our cats potentially causing aggression and issues (We later learned from a vet that the recommended age gap for cats is only 2 years).

After a three week isolation period, the cats met face to face, and aside from typical kitten energy occasionally spooking the older cats, they seemed to get along well.

When the kitten turned 1 year old, we moved to a home, doubling our square footage. Overtime, the kitten seemed to become more aggressive to the older cats.

It is now to the point where the other cats will hiss and run away from the kitten, as he will attack them randomly, and we're not talking a play fight, we're talking a fight fight. It's very clear that he may need to be a solo cat, as he has become very territorial.

We have tried bumping up play time, adding more places for the cats to get off the ground, and now he's been isolated into an office space for about 6 weeks, to attempt ""reintroduction"", at the advice of our vet.

Out vet also recently prescribed liquid alprazolam for him to go on, and after watching videos of cats on this medicine, I do NOT feel comfortable with him on this for an extended period of time.

I am at the point where I would like to rehome him. The adoption agency said they will rehome him no problem, and list that he needs to be a single cat.

My husband is overwhelmingly against this. He does not want to give him up, as he has dealt with a lot of pet loss in his life. I am terrified he will resent me if we decide to rehome the younger cat.

Does anyone have any other suggestions we can try to help keep the younger cat entertained, and keep the peace among our cats?

577,1668369095,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a cat about two months ago, and she’s nearly perfect. She’s never had an issue with her litter box, pretty good temperament, and after a vet appointment, is known to be in perfect health. I posted on here when I first got her to ask for general advice, and I’ve followed it. The only problem is that she will not stop tearing up the carpet.

I grew up in a house with carpet with three cats, two of which came to us declawed, one of which we got as a kitten and were able to keep her claws. In all the years I had them, they never had issues with clawing up the carpet. Ever since I adopted my new cat, the carpet on the inside of my bedroom door has been torn up day and night. She’s kept inside my room when I sleep, or when no one else is home, but aside from that, usually has free roam of the house.

At first, I thought it was the scratching post. Bought her a new post that she took to immediately, and loves to scratch. 

She kept scratching the carpet, so I got a horizontal scratching post that I fixed to the door. Came home to the post ripped off of the door and the carpet torn up to the floorboards. 

Sprayed a dose of feliway before I left, and came back to more shredded carpet. Sprayed about three doses, and still, more carpet that she’s torn up.

I caved and got one of the plastic mats that fix to the carpet, and it worked for about a week before she started tearing up the carpet around the border of the mat.

I’m sitting with her right now in my room, in front of my door, and she keeps hopping around my legs to tear at the carpet as if I’m not here.

I’m at my breaking point with her. I can’t leave her alone to go to class without worrying about how much carpet she’s ripping up while I’m gone. Her litter box is always clean before I leave, her water filled up, and her food fresh. I trim her nails on schedule so they don’t get too long. She has toys around my room to play with, and a nice scratching post I know she likes the feel of.

583,1668364488,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey everyone, 

I have one 4-year-old female cat. I have been looking into automatic feeders because of upcoming travel, and so I can establish a set routine for her. I feed her a small amount at a time, but more frequently because she has a problem with eating too fast, so I am hoping to find a feeder with small portions but more meal times to help with that. 

She has a more independent personality, so feeding and playtime are when I feel that I actually bond with her. The only thing I'm worried about with the automatic feeder is that she will lose that bond with me because I will no longer be the direct food source. 

I have researched a little about automatic, microchip, and smart feeders, and found some pretty good brands like PetLibro and Dogness. I am currently looking for something reliable, reasonably priced, and has a way of tracking meal times (like a log) so I can refer to them later. Any recommendations or advice for feeders, and your experience with them, would be helpful.

584,1668363677,self.CatAdvice,True,"I am once again asking for your advice-shaped support!

Backstory: 

About a month ago I adopted Cookie Dough, a rescue kitten who is about 6 months old according to the vets. I already have a cat called Milkyway who is 2 years old. They're both female and spayed.

It took about a week for them to warm up to each other and Milky seemed to really enjoy Cookie's presence. I've had Milky since she was a few weeks old and safe for some visits elsewhere she has been an only child so far. So having a little playmate to actually play catch with was great for her. It was clearly playful, since they reversed roles a lot and never gave any signs of distress.

Cookie is clearly traumatized from her time as a stray and took (and is still taking) time to warm up to me. By now Cookie clearly adores both of us - she wants to be around us every waking and sleeping minute, napping on my legs and always coming over to see what Milky is up to.

Problem:

Milky seems to be starting to have regrets. She's withdrawing more from us, spending more time in my roommate's room (when she rarely left my side before). It doesn't help that when she comes over to ask for play or snuggles, Cookie wants to know what's up and engage with her. I see Milky rejecting Cookie more, smacking her away when she comes close and yesterday we even had a brief, tense staredown. I broke it up by redirecting their attention, but that spooked me.

I assume that the novelty has worn off and Milkyway wishes she could return to her old routine by now. I notice this in how she has picked some old behavior back up, like begging me for play even when Cookie is zooming in the background. Sometimes she approaches me and looks downright disappointed to see Cookie around.

Is this something I need to worry about? How can I make this easier for her? Do any of you have experience with this kind of reaction and can tell me how long it might last?

I miss my Milkybaby, especially when she stays away almost all day.

What I'm already trying:

I gently ward Cookie off when Milkyway comes to cuddle with me. It does not give her enough calm to continue for long though.

I check up on Milky sometimes, just seeking her out and asking her if she's okay. Petting her a little if she seems fine with it.

I try to engage both of them in play at the same time. For example, I throw something for Milkyway, then practice a trick with Cookie. When Milky comes back, I throw something for her again.

I try to make sure they never have to compete for resources, especially food and snacks. Both of them are pretty foodmotivated, so I do my best to always provide enough and distribute it enough that no tension arises.

And I've bought a pheromone diffuser that should be effective on the whole apartment. I already used those pheromones for the introduction and that seemed to help them.",0,"2yo cat seems to get sick of 6mo kitten, what do?",text,527,"['2yo', 'cat', 'seems', 'get', 'sick', '6mo', 'kitten', 'asking', 'adviceshaped', 'supportbackstory', 'month', 'ago', 'adopted', 'cookie', 'dough', 'rescue', 'kitten', '6', 'month', 'old', 'according', 'vet', 'already', 'cat', 'called', 'milkyway', '2', 'year', 'old', 'theyre', 'female', 'spayedit', 'took', 'week', 'warm', 'milky', 'seemed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'cooky', 'presence', 'ive', 'milky', 'since', 'week', 'old', 'safe', 'visit', 'elsewhere', 'child', 'far', 'little', 'playmate', 'actually', 'play', 'catch', 'great', 'clearly', 'playful', 'since', 'reversed', 'role', 'lot', 'never', 'gave', 'sign', 'distresscookie', 'clearly', 'traumatized', 'time', 'stray', 'took', 'still', 'taking', 'time', 'warm', 'cookie', 'clearly', 'adores', 'u', 'want', 'around', 'u', 'every', 'waking', 'sleeping', 'minute', 'napping', 'leg', 'always', 'coming', 'see', 'milky', 'toproblemmilky', 'seems', 'starting', 'regret', 'shes', 'withdrawing', 'u', 'spending', 'time', 'roommate', 'room', 'rarely', 'left', 'side', 'doesnt', 'help', 'come', 'ask', 'play', 'snuggle', 'cookie', 'want', 'know', 'whats', 'engage', 'see', 'milky', 'rejecting', 'cookie', 'smacking', 'away', 'come', 'close', 'yesterday', 'even', 'brief', 'tense', 'staredown', 'broke', 'redirecting', 'attention', 'spooked', 'mei', 'assume', 'novelty', 'worn', 'milkyway', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'old', 'routine', 'notice', 'picked', 'old', 'behavior', 'back', 'like', 'begging', 'play', 'even', 'cookie', 'zooming', 'background', 'sometimes', 'approach', 'look', 'downright', 'disappointed', 'see', 'cookie', 'aroundis', 'something', 'need', 'worry', 'make', 'easier', 'experience', 'kind', 'reaction', 'tell', 'long', 'might', 'lasti', 'miss', 'milkybaby', 'especially', 'stay', 'away', 'almost', 'daywhat', 'im', 'already', 'tryingi', 'gently', 'ward', 'cookie', 'milkyway', 'come', 'cuddle', 'give', 'enough', 'calm', 'continue', 'long', 'thoughi', 'check', 'milky', 'sometimes', 'seeking', 'asking', 'shes', 'okay', 'petting', 'little', 'seems', 'fine', 'iti', 'try', 'engage', 'play', 'time', 'example', 'throw', 'something', 'milkyway', 'practice', 'trick', 'cookie', 'milky', 'come', 'back', 'throw', 'something', 'againi', 'try', 'make', 'sure', 'never', 'compete', 'resource', 'especially', 'food', 'snack', 'pretty', 'foodmotivated', 'best', 'always', 'provide', 'enough', 'distribute', 'enough', 'tension', 'arisesand', 'ive', 'bought', 'pheromone', 'diffuser', 'effective', 'whole', 'apartment', 'already', 'used', 'pheromone', 'introduction', 'seemed', 'help']",yo seems get sick mo kitten asking adviceshaped supportbackstory month ago adopted cookie dough rescue kitten  month old according vet already called milkyway  year old theyre female spayedit took week warm milky seemed really enjoy cooky presence ive milky since week old safe visit elsewhere child far little playmate actually play catch great clearly playful since reversed role lot never gave sign distresscookie clearly traumatized time stray took still taking time warm cookie clearly adores u want around u every waking sleeping minute napping leg always coming see milky toproblemmilky seems starting regret shes withdrawing u spending time roommate room rarely left side doesnt help come ask play snuggle cookie want know whats engage see milky rejecting cookie smacking away come close yesterday even brief tense staredown broke redirecting attention spooked mei assume novelty worn milkyway wish could return old routine notice picked old behavior back like begging play even cookie zooming background sometimes approach look downright disappointed see cookie aroundis something need worry make easier experience kind reaction tell long might lasti miss milkybaby especially stay away almost daywhat im already tryingi gently ward cookie milkyway come cuddle give enough calm continue long thoughi check milky sometimes seeking asking shes okay petting little seems fine iti try engage play time example throw something milkyway practice trick cookie milky come back throw something againi try make sure never compete resource especially food snack pretty foodmotivated best always provide enough distribute enough tension arisesand ive bought pheromone diffuser effective whole apartment already used pheromone introduction seemed help

587,1668360925,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I’m 22F, and recently became the owner of a 12-week-old ragdoll kitten. 

I am not a first-time cat owner but technically I am since living on my own away from home! I live with my friend who also has some experience owning cats with her family. 

I did some research into the best cat breeds to keep indoors as we live in a city on a busy street, and recently purchased a 12-week-old rag doll girl kitten, she’s very well-behaved, purrs constantly and sleeps all day pretty much - but I worry that being indoors won’t be enough for her! She has bursts of energy where she tries to nibble plants and wires and scratch things but so far I have been around to redirect and distract her with toys - I just worry about when I’m not. I also worry the location of my flat is too noisy for her, although she seems ok. I live above a busy, noisy shop also, which might not be ideal. 

Our flat isn’t tiny but we don’t have a garden and will have to keep all the windows closed at all times in case she gets out. I’m not sure if it’s normal to feel this way but I’m incredibly anxious about leaving her alone, and just owning a cat in general.  

I work part-time, around 3-4 8-hour shifts a week and am also a student as is my flatmate. I did consider this before getting her but my flatmate and I both concluded there is almost always one of us at home within a 4-hour window at the very least. 

It is only day 3 now and I’ve only left her alone once for just under an hour - she seemed ok, but she was asleep. when she’s awake and I leave the room she cries, which worries me even more about leaving her alone! I’ve cat-proofed the flat as much as possible but I’m worried about things falling on her etc if she plays with them. I also plan on getting netting for the windows just in case. 

She has food and water out in the rooms she has access to (currently only my room and the living room/kitchen area), and a cat tree in the living room. When I go out I shut my bedroom door just to confine her to one area and minimise any potential damage! I hope this is ok? I’m not sure if this is irrational but we have one of those induction hob things that stays hot for a while after you use it and I’m worried about her jumping on it (she hasn’t yet even jumped on the counter), also jumping around and getting stuck somewhere she can’t get out and consuming plants she’s not supposed to, I’ve put them all up high and out of reach but I’m still paranoid. This was never a problem with my other cats so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking things! 

I’m not sure if I’ve taken on more than I can cope with or if these anxieties will ease over time. I’m terrified to actually go to work and leave her alone properly, I couldn’t relax at all just going to the shops! 

I do also feel slightly guilty about her having no access to the outside and no other cats to play with. The only reason I was able to purchase such a lovely cat was that I inherited just enough money from my grandmother passing away to invest in a cat, which I’ve wanted for a while, and she loved cats so it just felt right. However, I am stressing about not being a good enough home for her. I know it’s only been a few days but I haven’t really been able to relax, the first night I had her I didn’t really sleep because every time she would get up and walk around I’d bolt up to check on her. I’m being hyper-vigilant but I’m paranoid about accidentally leaving a window open, the stove on, a door open, a knife or something she shouldn’t eat on the counter etc. is this normal and if so, does the constant pet paranoia go away? 

I am fortunate enough to have the safety net of my mum, who is desperate to have her, we have had some pet and human losses over the past year that has affected us all, but especially my mum and she misses a small fluffy thing to cuddle, in her words. The cat they have now is much more aloof whereas this kitten never leaves my side and is much more of a lap cat, I know they’d love and mutually benefit from each other’s company. However, my dad isn’t so keen. They live somewhat near me but in a much safer area where she would have another cat to play with, access to the outside and a much larger indoor area too. My parents are also almost always home as they WFH, unlike me. My mum is ready to take her in a heartbeat but I would almost feel embarrassed and ashamed about taking on such a responsibility and not being able to handle it, but I also just want what’s best for the cat - which is what’s giving me such anxiety! In theory, I would plan to take her back when I am no longer a student and/or move to somewhere with a garden. 

I just worry I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. When I think about my parents temporarily (when I say temporary I mean a over a year, so she won’t be going back and forth much) adopting her it brings me a great sense of relief if I’m honest, and I’d see her frequently. I might be overthinking it all as it is early days and she is only 12 weeks so she’s bound to calm down a bit and it should get easier, but since I’ve had her in my care I have an almost constant sense of anxiety. Also just as a side note, another reason why I am even considering giving her to my parents is that my having a cat is that it pretty much eliminates the possibility of my boyfriend having his dog over to the flat that he shares with an ex, which is a shame. 
 
If you think this is a better alternative for her please let me know or if you have any kind words and advice it would be appreciated.",0,"Anxious new kitten owner, thinking about temporarily

588,1668360419,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all! 

So I’ll start this by saying I’ve already got a vet appointment lined up for my girl. Just wanted some general feedback/experiences!

The past two days, one of my cats (4f) has been leaving small (usually just one tiny piece) poops around the house. One last night was fairly solid and regular.

592,1668353823,self.CatAdvice,True,"My kitten is now 5-weeks old and I've taken her under my care ever since she was a newborn (her mother basically just abandoned her). Since last week (November 8), I started bottle-feeding her with both gruel and formula milk. I've tried training her to jump on her plate (hopefully to atleast smell the food) but she would just run around it. I also tried putting some of the wet food directly to her mouth to which she would try to taste and munch, but never on her own volition. Since it's been 5 days since her first taste of gruel, I tried putting the mix again on the plate in small amounts. She started licking some of it on her own, but not all. I tried placing the leftovers on her spoon and she would sloppily lick it, but then again, not all. So I guess, my question is, is our pacing normal? Or are we doing the weaning process too slowly? I'm scared of forcing her to feed because she might develop some aversion to her wet food if I do. Also, do you have other ideas or techniques that you could share to us?

As for the gruel mixture (the one on her bottle), I usually just mix 1/2 tbsp of her milk to 2 1/2 tbsp of water, then to 1 1/2 tbsp of wet food (Royal Canin Mother and Baby Cat starter food). As for the one on her plate, I usually mix 1.5L of her gruel and a small amount of wet food for thicker consistency (when I relied solely on her pre-made gruel mixture, she almost inhaled the milk so I was afraid to make the consistency thinner because she might aspirate).",0,How long does the weaning process usually last?,text,296,"['long', 'weaning', 'process', 'usually', 'last', 'kitten', '5weeks', 'old', 'ive', 'taken', 'care', 'ever', 'since', 'newborn', 'mother', 'basically', 'abandoned', 'since', 'last', 'week', 'november', '8', 'started', 'bottlefeeding', 'gruel', 'formula', 'milk', 'ive', 'tried', 'training', 'jump', 'plate', 'hopefully', 'atleast', 'smell', 'food', 'would', 'run', 'around', 'also', 'tried', 'putting', 'wet', 'food', 'directly', 'mouth', 'would', 'try', 'taste', 'munch', 'never', 'volition', 'since', '5', 'day', 'since', 'first', 'taste', 'gruel', 'tried', 'putting', 'mix', 'plate', 'small', 'amount', 'started', 'licking', 'tried', 'placing', 'leftover', 'spoon', 'would', 'sloppily', 'lick', 'guess', 'question', 'pacing', 'normal', 'weaning', 'process', 'slowly', 'im', 'scared', 'forcing', 'feed', 'might', 'develop', 'aversion', 'wet', 'food', 'also', 'idea', 'technique', 'could', 'share', 'usa', 'gruel', 'mixture', 'one', 'bottle', 'usually', 'mix', '12', 'tbsp', 'milk', '2', '12', 'tbsp', 'water', '1', '12', 'tbsp', 'wet', 'food', 'royal', 'canin', 'mother', 'baby', 'cat', 'starter', 'food', 'one', 'plate', 'usually', 'mix', '15l', 'gruel', 'small', 'amount', 'wet', 'food', 'thicker', 'consistency', 'relied', 'solely', 'premade', 'gruel', 'mixture', 'almost', 'inhaled', 'milk', 'afraid', 'make', 'consistency', 'thinner', 'might', 'aspirate']",long weaning process usually last kitten weeks old ive taken care ever since newborn mother basically abandoned since last week november  started bottlefeeding gruel formula milk ive tried training jump plate hopefully atleast smell food would run around also tried putting wet food directly mouth would try taste munch never volition since  day since first taste gruel tried putting mix plate small amount started licking tried placing leftover spoon would sloppily lick guess question pacing normal weaning process slowly im scared forcing feed might develop aversion wet food also idea technique could share usa gruel mixture one bottle usually mix  tbsp milk   tbsp water   tbsp wet food royal canin mother baby starter food one plate usually mix l gruel small amount wet food thicker consistency relied solely premade gruel mixture almost inhaled milk afraid make consistency thinner might aspirate

We had another cat already a year old tabby male, ill refer to him as A who actually loves other cats and has his whole life. At his Foster moms house he has house mates he got along with. When i first got him, my roommate had a cat which he saw as his friend. When I got a new job in my home town and we had to move into my parents house he got along really well with my brothers cat.

Early this morning we heard P cry, she never cries and so my partner got up and we noticed A was hovering over P . Upon further inspection we noticed that P had used the floor instead of the litter box. My partner said that He had noticed even earlier that On top of the little box, but he didn’t see Her in it. Now we know she was and he was bugging her which led her to using the floor. We put A in one of the crates we have while my partner got ready for work and P was able to use the little box free of intrusion. 
We are unsure of what to do, they eat and drink out of the same bowls even at the same time and during the day.  He doesn’t bug her when she goes to use the little box during the day either but we don’t know how to stop it at night when we aren’t awake.

594,1668352978,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello, my boy Jetpack is soon to be an outdoor cat, having been an indoor cat his whole life.

We are moving onto a boat (!) permanently moored against a grass bank. He has been outside in limited capacity (access to an enclosed rooftop and walks with harness) He is chipped, neutered, vaccinated (yearly vet appt upcoming to know if he needs boosters). Along with the many other careful and crucial steps to rehabilitate him as well as cat-safe-ing my craft inside and out, I need to get him wearing his collar.

Few questions:
- are there any alternatives to tags and/ or collars? I want to give as little opportunity for him to get snagged on anything. 

- any tips for resettling an indoor cat? (I know about creating a scent, bringing familiar smells inside and outside areas, keeping him in for a good few weeks to rehome)

- there is one other neutered male cat on the land (very nice boy but hasn’t met jetpack), how can I respect his home whilst integrating jetpack, or is it not my business?

606,1668330347,self.CatAdvice,True,"When we got our 8 month old, spayed cat from a rescue about 4 months ago, she would cover up her food with her old kennel towel that we brought home for her. Eventually, that developed into a few scratches in the air over each side of her dish, eventually turning to one or two scratches on the rim of the bowl or nearby desk. We talked to one of the women from the rescue and she said that her cat did it too and that she was just being dramatic. We did a little search online and found that cats from shelters could have that behavior from having to share food. We thought it would eventually go away, and it wasn't hurting anything, so we let it go. Now it's gotten to the point where any time she eats or uses the bathroom, she sits on her back feet and uses both front paws to quickly and loudly scratch on any nearby walls nonstop for minutes on end. I'm not sure why she does it; it doesn't seem like the point is really to cover anything anymore. It feels like a compulsion. She does it and she does it until she feels like she's done it enough. But she does it very often and it's gotten so bad that it wakes us up every time and tends to keep us awake until she's finished, to the point where we often have a hard time finally going to sleep once she has finished. It's starting to really effect our sleep. We have one other cat, but he's not very competitive about food. In fact, he often steps back and waits for her to finish eating if she comes to eat while he's at the bowl. They get along very well. We have a new cat tree thing near their food that has scratching posts as every post, but they don't use it at all. She does have other things that she sharpens her claws on though, so I don't think that's the issue here. I'm not sure how to stop this behavior, largely because I don't know why she's doing it. I tried putting  wash cloths near the food dish in hopes that she would cover her food with them and be satisfied, but she hasn't touched them.

I can’t keep her in my room for the night because my other cats like my room and when I did put her in my room, she kept growling and hissing.

610,1668322038,self.CatAdvice,True,"Lately, I feel like my cat has been bored. She kind of just wanders around aimlessly or sleeps more than usual. I do work nightshift 12 hour shifts so I am gone an extended period of time, and when I get home, I sleep an extended period of time. 

She has her own bedroom with:

• a TV (i play birds or a string game she likes on it) 

• 3 cat towers (one infront of a window)
• a puzzle toy

• scattered small toys

• a door hanging mouse on a string she can jump and play with

• a crinkle tunnel 

• a ripple rug she can jump in and out of and play in

• a 3 tier corrugated cardboard house 

• one of those 3 tier ball towers they hit the ball around 

In my room she has: 

• an old iPad that plays little games on it 24/7 she can play with

• a cat tower infront of another window

•little small mouse toys and ball toys

• an interactive toy that’s like a whack a mole kind of thing 

In the living room she has a scratcher toy, another 3 tier ball tower toy and another cat tree in front of a big bay window. 

And in the kitchen she has another cat tree in front of another big window. 

But she still seems to be bored and most of the time just lays on the floor. She has been wanting to outside and meows at the door but I do not want to go out there with her because she refuses to let me put on her harness. I do have a pet stroller for her we can take a walk in, so we did that tonight. But then we get inside and it’s the same thing. 

Does anyone have any more tips of what I could do to help make her life better or her not be so bored?? Everything I’ve found on Google to do she either already has or is not interested in.

I've had my ~2 year old former stray for a couple of months, and every time I shower he gets so concerned.

620,1668303911,self.CatAdvice,True,"I live in a house with 3 cats (Olivia, Bobbit and Dale) and Bobbit is causing a lot of trouble and stress for the other cats and me. He is very pushy when demanding attention and often scares off Olivia when I give her attention. He has always been quite friendly and fine with people but is often quite aggressive when ""playing"" with Olivia. She has no interest in playing with him and, since she is quite small, has no real way to defend herself. Every now and then he will chase her and pounce. She really hates this, screaming and scaring everyone. It sounds awful but I don't think that he has ever actually hurt her, no blood or anything.

I am always on edge when he starts following her or I hear him running. We moved house a few months ago and I was hoping the more busy living arrangements would mellow him out a bit but he hasn't changed and even started bullying Dale, who is about 50% bigger but a huge softy. I don't know if it is under-stimulation but he gets more attention than the others so I'm not sure.

627,1668300609,self.CatAdvice,True,"So this is really, really ridiculous, but now that I’ve gotten him into this, I don’t know how to get him out of it. He, like most cats, really likes his snackies. However, him eating them and getting his full enjoyment out of it started as him liking it when I watch him eat. His name is ButtButt, he’s 8 years old,  I’ve had him for 7 years, and he likes me to tell him what a good EaterButt he is when he’s eating. 

However, this has now evolved to him only eating his snackies while I’m bent way over, reaching under his undercarriage and rubbing his front armpits/chest and upper tummy while I both talk to him the entire time and/or sing to him while I do said undercarriage rubbing. 

As soon as I stop and start walking away then he’ll stop eating and wander away. So just to be clear, it’s only with his snackies, my participation is not necessary during him eating anything else and he’s definitely not underfed, he’s got a little bit of chonk on him. 

How do I break it to my cat that him eating and enjoying his snackies does not need to be a two person event? Or should I just resign myself to my fate that from here on out I’m going to have to rub my cats armpits and sing to him in order for him to get his full enjoyment out of his snackies?",0,My cat has now developed this habit where eating his snackies (and only those) has now become a two person activity.

628,1668299951,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted my cat about a year and a half ago. I'm not sure of her exact age but the vet estimated around 8. She is beautiful, sweet and affectionate a lot of the time but she is also a bit aggressive. If I walk past her too often when she is in the hallway or on the couch she will swipe at me. She also occasionally chases me around the house and playfully bites and swipes my legs. I don't think either of these things are actual aggression, I suspect she may need more play. The trouble I'm having is that she seems to get bored quickly when I play with her. I use a laser toy to get her very excited then I switch to a piece of string on a stick which she loves. I try to make her run as much as possible and climb as much as possible during the play sessions but she gets bored quite quickly. I have tried to use different toys with her but she is only interested in the laser and the string. I tried to tie a bird toy to the string but she wasn't interested. I would like for her to be able to properly bite and kick and ""kill"" what she ""hunts"" when we play but she can't do that with the laser or the string really. We also sometimes play hide and seek where I hide and poke my head out to let her see me then she runs to me and catches me (doesnt swipe or bite me during this). She enjoys this but my house is small so she gets bored quickly with this too. 


She's an indoor only cat, she can look out windows all day and I leave the back door open so she can look into the garden while I'm home, when I go to work and when I sleep I leave puzzle feeders out for her.

634,1668295544,self.CatAdvice,True,"hi! so i have a 2.5 year old neutered male cat named kiwi who i’ve had for 1.5 years now. he came from a not so nice home and has a lot of anxiety around strangers but once he warms up, is very sweet and loves pets. he also is notoriously SUPER vocal, meowing all the time and having whole conversations with me especially in the morning (nothing concerning just talks a lot).

i recently (3 weeks ago) made the decision to get a kitten for a variety of reasons, two of them being so that kiwi can have a playmate and some company since he’s very playful, and also in the hopes that having a more sociable cat around might help his anxiety a bit in the long run.

new kitten’s name is fig, also male and about 12 weeks old now. it’s actually been going really well between them, they play all the time, sleep near each other (haven’t cuddled yet but i think that’s not necessarily a red flag), kiwi will also groom fig which usually turns into more playing. basically it feels like things are going great!

the only thing is that kiwi is wayyy less vocal with me than he used to be. he still meows at me from time to time and makes a lot of smaller meows and trilling noises with fig but it’s nowhere near as much as it was before. i’m not really seeing any other behavioral changes and he seems to enjoy fig’s presence and i show him plenty of affection so he doesn’t get jealous. i have a theory that maybe some of his meowing from before was out of loneliness and so less meowing now is actually a good thing, but the paranoid cat mom in me just wants some other opinions!

635,1668294117,self.CatAdvice,True,"hey there, my partner and i have added a new kitten into my little family. he is 3 months old, with only 3 feet, so we named him Yardstick. we expected our current cats, Eggy (3) and Miso (1) , to need time to adapt, but it’s been very strange thus far. 

Miso and Egg have been hissing at each other. obviously the baby, which was expected, but they’ve been very angry with each other too. i can’t quite figure out why, and it’s bothering me as they have been very close since Miso was young.

in addition, they get upset if they even hear the baby, so keeping him out of sight doesnt even really help. we moved him out of the bathroom (because he has a URI and is so miserable that he cries all the time), and into a covered playpen into the living room to hopefully fix this problem. Eggy adapted to him being there rather quickly, but he and Miso are still fighting each other.

636,1668293921,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone! I'd really appreciate any advice on this. 

My cat is 5 years old, active, and fairly anxious. He frequently does 4hr drives with me in his crate. I usually give him gabapentin the night before and morning of. He loves his crate but cries when it's closed.

Next week I'm doing a 13hr drive in one day to the top of the rocky mountains from basically sea level. I'm already worried about how he'll react to the elevation change. Logistically and financially, my best option is to take him even though I wish I didn't have to.

The vet tech recommended I let him roam in the cab and gave me tips to practice with him. I'm in the car with him now, parked. He stopped crying when I opened his crate. He looked around a bit but has been in his crate mostly. I've always been nervous about him being out in the car. Do the safety concerns outweigh his and my sanity? 

He can't wear a collar because his hair tangles horribly. I'm trying to train him on a harness and leash but he's not taking to it very well. Any tips to getting him comfortable wearing it?

642,1668290925,self.CatAdvice,True,"So, about 2 months ago, I took my old cat to the vet for him pooping outside the litter box. He ended up having a urinary blockage and was really sick, but he has since recovered and has been really healthy. My parents and I figured this was the cause of maybe why he has been pooping out of the box, but now that he’s perfectly healthy, he still keeps doing it, no matter what. Our carpet is completely destroyed.

We’ve tried many things. Getting a new litter box. Using pet repellent. Blocking off the area where he poops on the carpet but that also didn’t work. Moving his litter box to the place he poops. I even picked up his poop and placed it in the litter box to see if that would work by redirecting the scent, but of course, that didn’t work.

This one vet recommended pheromones, but I don’t wanna waste money because I feel like it’s a bunch of bullshit if the other things didn’t work. I’m running out of options at this point, and I love my family cat, but our basement is completely destroyed and smells like shit, and they’re more fed up than I am and my parents have made me the “executive poop picker upper.” I have to pick up multiple piles of a poop every other day, and I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. 

I’m assuming it’s feline dementia since the urinary blockage thing has been resolved given he’s super healthy otherwise now for his age.

Where do I go from here? Let him keep pooping how he has been until he dies? I don’t want him to die, and i think he has a few more years in him given his condition and energy. But my parents and I suspect he may be peeing outside the litter box, but I can’t smell anything nor can my parents.

where in my bedroom should i put the litter box? and how bad can i expect the smell to be? i’m planning on scooping 1-2x daily with a covered litter box and also getting a litter genie, and she’s just one cat as well, but i’m a little worried about breathing in the litter dust.

i’ve also got a tiny en suite bathroom attached to my room, but the issue here is that there’s not that much floor space so the litter box, if it fits, would be directly in front of my own toilet lol. that feels unsanitary so i’m not too sure what i should do…

really looking for any and all tips!! and hoping that my roommates either chill out or i can put the box in a different place once they both move down the line haha",0,litter box placement?,text,242,"['litter', 'box', 'placement', 'hello', 'everyone', 'couple', 'day', 'ago', 'approved', 'adopt', 'wonderful', 'little', 'cat', 'currently', 'process', 'getting', 'everything', 'ready', 'come', 'homethere', 'one', 'thing', 'still', 'little', 'unsure', 'though', 'roommate', 'insist', 'litter', 'box', 'bedroom', 'room', 'biggest', 'bit', 'annoying', 'honest', 'pretty', 'big', 'apartment', 'full', 'dining', 'room', 'one', 'really', 'us', 'understand', 'logic', 'really', 'one', 'sticking', 'point', 'bedroom', 'put', 'litter', 'box', 'bad', 'expect', 'smell', 'planning', 'scooping', '12x', 'daily', 'covered', 'litter', 'box', 'also', 'getting', 'litter', 'genie', 'one', 'cat', 'well', 'little', 'worried', 'breathing', 'litter', 'dusti', 'also', 'got', 'tiny', 'en', 'suite', 'bathroom', 'attached', 'room', 'issue', 'much', 'floor', 'space', 'litter', 'box', 'fit', 'would', 'directly', 'front', 'toilet', 'lol', 'feel', 'unsanitary', 'sure', 'really', 'looking', 'tip', 'hoping', 'roommate', 'either', 'chill', 'put', 'box', 'different', 'place', 'move', 'line', 'haha']",litter box placement hello everyone couple day ago approved adopt wonderful little currently process getting everything ready come homethere one thing still little unsure though roommate insist litter box bedroom room biggest bit annoying honest pretty big apartment full dining room one really us understand logic really one sticking point bedroom put litter box bad expect smell planning scooping x daily covered litter box also getting litter genie one well little worried breathing litter dusti also got tiny en suite bathroom attached room issue much floor space litter box fit would directly front toilet lol feel unsanitary sure really looking tip hoping roommate either chill put box different place move line haha

651,1668280588,self.CatAdvice,True,"HI! I adopted a cat (Cletus 1year male) in April. I have a few questions, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and lost. Just for inventory, Cletus has three scratch pads horizontal, and three that are vertical. He has one of those dish games that have the ball stuck in it so he can wack it around in a circle, a cat tower looking out a window. Two windows that have furniture underneath so he can look out those too. We play one-on-one with fetch (nurf bullets of all things hehe) for about an hour a day (I haven't found any other one-on-one activities he likes ) and he likes to play with pencils (just wacking them around not biting)

The thing is, my house is small, and when he gets the zooms, the man he is on it haha. He is running up the walls (there are scratch marks, and I'm worried il have to paint the whole house due to it being a rental) He is jumping on counters and knocking things over, including his feeding dish. I have a dog so I put Cletus' food on the table so he can eat it without worrying about Cassie ( my dog) eating it but now he is batting it on the ground. 

I think he is bored because he is jumping on surfaces and breaking a lot of things, but this is always when I'm at work ( so not sure if he is bored or just curious and clumsy). I've put double-sided sticky tape on all door frames to deter scratching which has worked....but I'm scared it will ruin my furniture if I put it on there. 

What can I do to entertain him to get his energy out? I work full-time and don't know what to do when I'm not here. Please help!!! I'm getting overwhelmed and have no idea what to do. Will he calm down, or will these be his permanent energy needs (he's an orange domestic short hair).

652,1668279603,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone!
I have had my resident cat (10yr female) for about 2 years, she was fostered with several other cats when we adopted her, so has lived with cats before but it has been 2 years since then.
2 months ago we made the decision to adopt another cat (2ish yr  male). He has also lived with other cats before and no concerns with him.


So we brought him home and to my knowledge we followed Jackson Galaxy to a T. Scent swapped, site swapped, other side of the door feeding until they were consistently eating beside each other no hissing. Moved on to eat, play, love. We know we've got a bit of an age and energy gap so we play with the new cat, and resident cat (and she gets lots of pets when she's loafing, same as before). We also play/treat both in new cat's basecamp and rest of the house to balance out territorial business.


Here's where I'm not sure if it's going wrong and if anyone has experience with something similar. They're fine 80% of the time, sleeping in the same room, passing in hallways, scrambling with zoomies past the other. Then every so often my resident cat just gets weird. She'll find an ambush spot on the stairs or something and go to chase/swat the new cat (doesn't look playful, her eyes will be dilated and ears back). Sometimes she'll be rolling over onto her back, in front of the new cat, and slow blinking at him, and then she'll randomly flip her top and chase/swat him away when it doesn't look like he's even moved or there's been some other noise to startle her. 


So Reddit, what do you think? Does this kind of behavior mellow out? Have we moved too fast somewhere along Jackson galaxy's advice? Do we keep doing what we're doing?


Other info:
- Resident cat had her yearly vet visit a couple weeks ago and clean bill of health
- haven't had any litterbox issues
- still separated overnight
- when I talk about the behaviour mellowing out I'd like to clarify that when we see my resident cat setting up an ambush we redirect her and try to get her playing and keep the new cat occupied away from ambush zone

653,1668278776,self.CatAdvice,True,"I’m going away to my parents’ for most of December and can’t bring my cat with me (traveling and border regulations). I’ve only ever left him one time for about two weeks and had a friend come over and she would hang out at my apartment most days. 

He’s a very social cat. He follows me around more often than not. Meows very loudly every time I (or my neighbors) come home. Even when I step out to pick up a package for less than a minute. 

I’m worried that he’ll feel too lonely if my friends can only stop by to feed him and clean his litter. I don’t think they’d be able to spend much time with him consistently every day. 

I have a friend who lives a bit far from me who said he could take him in. I haven’t been to his place yet though, so I’m not sure what the environment looks like. He has one roommate. He’s one of the few who will be around for the holidays. I feel like I’d need to see his place first. I’d probably also have to bring over some of my cat’s things (on top of food, water fountain, litter box, etc.) so he feels comfortable. I think this would be a good option so my cat is surrounded by people most of the time, but I know how cats hate changing environments. Plus if he stays at my place, I can keep an eye on him with the pet cams I have set up. 

I don’t know what the best option is. I’ll be gone for almost 5 weeks.

662,1668274283,self.CatAdvice,True,"A few months ago my cat started to tip her water bowl over and paw at her water to make it fall out. I posted here and the advice was to get a water fountain. Well, she treated the water fountain as a water park, playing in the water and getting both her and the carpet soaked (i live in a carpeted apartment). We got a mat under the fountain but she flicked the water beyond the mat. After two weeks maybe we took the motor out of the fountain and used it as just a big water bowl instead, hoping that it was big enough for her to not tip over. That worked fine for a while, but more recently she has started to dip her paws in the water and play with the water anyway. I tried to counteract that by putting less water in, but that just enabled her to flip the bowl over and make a bigger mess.

666,1668267074,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi!
My baby is almost 5 months old and approaching his neuter appointment. His vet is an cat only clinic and has mentioned that they normally keep cats overnight after being neutered to make sure they don’t jump for the first 24 hours, etc. She told me there was no way I would be able to prevent this at home, which may be true, but I had planned to stay home with him for the first few days afterwards so that I can keep an eye in him. I could also get a crate for him to stay in the first night because I assume that is what they would do there. I’m extremely nervous about him staying overnight because he gets so anxious at the vet that he freezes up and trembles when I have to set him down. I don’t want to be pushy with the vet about him coming home that same day because obviously she’s the professional but at the same time I feel like he’d be more comfortable at home and that I could make sure he didn’t do anything to injure himself. Anyone ever been in a similar situation before? Did you push back? If your cat did have to stay overnight, were they okay anxiety wise once you got them back home?

it feels like i have tried everything! i’ve tried:

- playing with her before bed to wear her out (didn’t work)

- changing feeding times and making sure she has food in the morning

- locking her out of the bedroom (she just scratches at the door nonstop, and i think scratched the paint off in some places — i’m in a rental so i can’t wait long enough for her to stop)

- wearing earplugs 

- cat pheromone diffuser (stopped working after the first refill) 

- other stuff im probably too tired to remember

679,1668243853,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi, I have recently got a second cat and I am working on slowly introducing them. Today was the first day letting them be in the same room together and it went really well - they had a good sniff of each other, and eventually they both settled down and started bathing, napping, etc. I guess I let it go on a bit too much though. I was sitting on the bed with new cat, when old cat decided to jump on too. Old cat looked happy to relax, but when new cat noticed her she charged and it led to a full blown fight. I quickly shoved pillows between them to break it up. Now I have them in separate rooms again and they both seem pretty happy, but what should I do to prevent this in the future?

680,1668240832,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone. So I have a bit of a dilemma, or I guess more so just a situation I’d like some advice on and help in working out some potential road bumps. My (22f) boyfriend (23m) of five years and I have been renting apartments together for about three and a half years. In that time we have managed to accumulate two wonderful cats, and similar to all of you, I love them so incredibly much. 
We currently live in a city where rent is extremely high, and honestly it can be kind of hard sometimes. I’d say we’re living just slightly above paycheck to paycheck. 

Anyways, my grandparents, who currently live on the farm they raised me on, have generously invited the four of us to come and stay with them and help them around the property for a few years while saving up money to potentially buy our own house. As I’m sure you can imagine if you’ve ever been poor, this sounds fucking awesome. My grandparents would not be charging us rent, just things like helping with groceries and electricity. 
However, I’m concerned for my cats. Firstly, my grandparents have an utterly massive Labrador named Jack. I’m talking 140 pounds. He’s nice, but cats are small, and even accidentally he could potentially kill them. He mainly stays downstairs, but I can’t guarantee always. Not to mention the onslaught of wildlife outdoors in the rural area that would make them into lunch. 
One of my cats, Pumpkin, is about 8 years old and would have no issue staying in what would become our bedroom (which is pretty large). But my younger girl, Mochi, can sometimes be a bit adventurous, and I honestly just feel completely petrified at the idea of her somehow getting out and coming face to face with Jack (who again, isn’t violent, just a unit), or God forbid getting outside. 

This would be a life changing opportunity, and if we could stick it out a year or two and save our incomes we could likely get together a down payment for a house. But nothing is really more important to me right now than my cats well-being. 

Could I make them happy living in that one room? Could I effectively keep them in there, safe? Does this seem ridiculous? 
I’m sorry this is so long, I’m just trying to really fill in the details. Does anyone have any advice? I’m feeling so conflicted. 

I have some ideas. Like making the closet into an area just for them, cat shelves, tall trees for them, baby gate at the door, self cleaning litter box to keep the small area clean… but would it be enough?

682,1668238739,self.CatAdvice,True,"Several months ago I introduced a new cat (F) into the household that was very cat reactive. I won’t use the word aggressive because she reacts out of fear and up until very recently she didn’t seem to want to start fights, just avoid them. She was very suspicious of my previous two cats (M + F) and growled and hissed anytime she would see them for weeks, but we slowly got to a place that they coexisted.  


We’re now at a place where they coexist a majority of the time. She’s even starting to sleep near the male who is more tolerant of her. The other female wants nothing to do with her. It feels like she “burned a bridge” and now she won’t let her redeem herself. She growls when she gets too close or seems too interested in her. They won’t sniff each other or greet each other, even though they would in the past.  


Now at bedtime when we settle down, and in the morning just before we usually wake, the new cat will chase the female through the house until she’s trapped her under the nightstand. They’ll both growl and not stop unless we separate them. It doesn’t escalate beyond growling, but the initial chase is super stressful to her. She doesn’t do this at all during the day, or through the middle of the night.

684,1668231737,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi!

I’m a new cat owner. I adopted a 3y old black male cat who weights around 12.5lbs and is fairly long about a month ago. The foster parent I got him from was feeding him two 3oz servings of fancy feast tuna and about 1 cup of kibble. 

I’ve kept up the portions but I’ve switched his wet food to the wellness brand. He had some loose stools on fancy feast so I figured it wasn’t the best option for him.

I feed him two 3oz wellness chicken herring meals—the first around 11am and the second around 7pm. I then have an auto feeder that feeds him a little less than 1/4 cup of kibble at 9am, 2:30pm, 9pm, and 12am. He seems like he is a healthy weight but I want to make sure that I’m neither over feeding him nor under feeding him. As a side note, he’s fairly active and plays with his toys twice a day for a good 10 minutes. He also uses his water fountain throughout the day. Lastly, he will not finish kibble if he’s full, so he grazes on it rather than finishes the entire thing if he’s not that hungry.

686,1668230924,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all! Recently my cat has developed some behavioral changes that is concerning me. She is generally fine in the day, I play with her and she sleeps like normal. But at night shortly after I fall asleep she has started to lightly scratch me or scream in my face to wake me up. This will continue the entire night, I haven’t been able to sleep because of it. 

Some changes in our lives (that I don’t know is necessarily relevant): she has been sick for quite some time. She started coughing two years ago and every time I brought it up to the vet she dismissed it. The first time my partner brought her in, they finally did tests and found out she has a lung condition, as well as asthma. She has been on steroids for about a week now and she has stopped coughing. For me, I got Covid 3 months ago which triggered insulin resistance and my blood sugar stayed above 300 for a while (even when fasting). At that time both of my cats were attentive and I knew the reason why. Now my sugars are under control and things went back to normal. The only other thing is the fact that I’m on antibiotics because one of them scratched me and caused an abscess that I had drained the day this all started. (Again I don’t know if this is relevant but cats can sense a lot of things.) 

Other than that, nothing has really changed in our lives. My partner travels for work which started almost 3 years ago, but she wasn’t really phased by it.

Recently my wife and I had to move back in with family. We have 4 cats all ages 6-2. We thankfully had found someone to foster them long term until we were able to move back out, unfortunately today our foster told us that they no longer foster our cats so in now we're weighing our options. 

Now on to the main point, my thoughts were to build a cation type enclosure for our 4 cats in our families back yard (they don't want them in the house). All 4 of them have been indoor cats their whole lives and have almost no experience being outdoors. To keep them safe I felt like an enclosure with little individual houses/boxes would work. 

My wife's worry is that since it's starting to get colder as winter gets closer that they'll get too cold. 

Just hoping for some ideas or insight. It's not very likely that we'll be able to find another long term foster for them, even if they're split up.

688,1668228358,self.CatAdvice,True,"This week I adopted a 4-month-old female Siamese-mix kitten from a veterinarian in a small midwestern town. Before picking her up, she was already spayed, vaccinated, litter trained, and is very well-socialized and outgoing. She’s amazing and everything I’ve ever dreamed of.

However, she demands my near-constant attention. It’s to the point where she cannot sleep unless I am next to her, and she will even wake up and follow me if I walk away from her while she’s sleeping. And she struggles to play independently, amongst other things. I spend several hours daily playing with her. I work from home, so I need to be able to get a few hours of work done. 

Is this separation anxiety? She was rescued from a parking lot when she was only a few days old, and was nursed to health for several weeks by veterinarians for a long time—so maybe she’s used to constantly being held and touched?

689,1668227492,self.CatAdvice,True,"So me and hubby saved a cat from getting ran over a few months ago (I mean this dummy of a kitten was literally running TOWARDS oncoming traffic)and at first he was very distant and scared of us but now he's more comfortable with being around us and even let's us pick him up (sometimes). We do have a few problems tho. For starters we can't decide on what the best food for him is (both dry &amp; wet), we also don't know how often to feed him, at the moment we usually feed him whenever one of us first wakes up, then we either take food away and give it back to him after a couple of hours at a time or we leave it out for him all day and by the middle of the day he's eaten all of it and is hungry again. Another issue were having is training him to not bite/scratch us when we pet/play with him, it's getting a little too annoying/painful to even try to play with him ourselves because he sees our hands and feet as toys...which use to be cute, but now it just hurts. Another issue is that hubby has 2 pet birds that are always in their cage, but ever since we brought our fur baby home, he had tried to get to the birds at every opportunity, it was so bad that we ended up having to move the birds to the high ground so that he can't reach them. Another issue is that whenever we try to eat some food out in the open, he'll try his damnest to sniff, lick, and/or straight up walk on our food, which is cute, until you remember where his mouth has been so you don't want him anywhere near something that you are about to consume. Our current solution to this is locking him in the Landry room until we're done eating (we're not proud of this, but it's the only way that we can eat in peace). How do you guys have the patience with your cats after they’ve bittenand/or scratched you for the umpteenth time in a single day? And last but not least...is him being a hyperactive kitten.

696,1668216832,self.CatAdvice,True,"So I've had my boy coming up for 4 months he's almost 8 months old  He picked me as his person on the very first time I visited and did the same everytime I went to visit his breeder who is a family member I wanted to see if it was a one time thing before deciding if he was my boy. He had no interest in other visitors previously or after just me alone and everyone said wow he chose you you must be his human your the only person he will play and sit with and we've had others visiting several times like you. So I was given him freely knowing I'd give him a good loving home like my previous cats who passed due to age. On adoption day it was asked if I could also take his sister since no one was really wanting her and to keep them as a pair but last minute another family said they wanted her so she was given to them instead    During initial meetings with  the litter his sister was the one I originally was interested in possibly adopting but showed absalutely no interest in me wouldn't even come near me which I didn't mind she in my eyes wasn't the cat for me as I always allowed pets to show if they're interested in me and my family members it was the way I was taught when getting dogs and used the same rule for my current kitten. 

I've now been asked today after the family member was kicked out of the place they were staying if I and my husband could also take my boys sister too permanently firstly by the owner then by the breeder family member. Originally I said no to his owner for various reasons but mostly because this person has a history of on and off again pet ownership when they decide it's too difficult or causing arguments where they live it's how we ended up with our beloved dog 

My boy is amazing but he's a handful and is slowly starting to calm down and be a cuddly cat and has always been loving, he's also starting to follow commands like no, get down off things he isn't supposed to be on with no punishment just redirection or picking him up off something he isn't allowed on. The family member his  breeder called tonight basically begging us to take his sibling as unbeknownst to me   they're also getting ready and in the process of rehoming the 4 other siblings from the same litter she kept them not realizing the costs of owning that many kittens along with the parents. Added the costs of neutering/spaying 4 kittens along with the parents prompted the rehoming kittens on the breeders part.

Here's my biggest issues the girl has not been spayed, no vaccines that we know of, the owner admitted the kitten is incredibly play aggressive and destructive tearing up the place where they lived resulting in arguments over the cat and one of the various reasons they got kicked out.  When we visited previously she litrelly hid and hissed at everyone several timss whereas my boy is social and happily comes to greet new comers to my house he's only hissed once and that was at his breeder *not sure why they still adore him* as it was the first thing I did was ask friends and family to visit and get the cat used to other people coming in his environment.

My husband also is torn while we have the room for another cat and she was originally was supposed to live here as a pair I don't know how my boy will react to his sister after being a single cat for 4 months. Can they still live together as siblings even after being apart this long?  I understand she will need to be spayed ASAP if she does but I'm also worried about the behavior she's displayed while being owned by a family member they do like animals and in no way to be nasty usually have a history of not being able to handle the needs of pets they've owned. My boys a bit scratchy but not destructive except with his own toys through play and occasionally the sofa but he does stop when he's told to use his tree 

I could afford it at a stretch but we'd have to use a low cost spay clinic due to the sudden addition as we planned financially for my current boy making sure we had everything covered vs with the potential sudden rehoming of his sibling with us. We did the same for our dog but didn't plan on potentially owning a second kitten this soon.

PS I want to say his litter was accidental and his parents have both since been neutered and spayed to prevent further litters

699,1668212839,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat Oliver won’t stop peeing outside the litter box. He does also pee inside the litter box, and only poops inside the litter box - so he clearly knows how to use it and doesn’t have an issue with it.

I’ve tried everything - uncovered box, partially covered box, fully covered box. All different types of litter. Scooping more often. Changing locations. He keeps peeing on the floor (but again, not every time)

He had a recent vet visit and they didn’t find anything wrong in that area. 

I got him fixed a few months ago, and hoped it would help. It hasn’t. 

My roommate and I lost our deposit at our last apartment over it.

My current apartment isn’t carpeted at all, which helps, because it’s much easier to clean, but it’s still a bad habit I want to break.

 He’s also very destructive. Loves breaking stuff, knocking stuff over, ripping stuff up. He’s still young, just over a year old but again I was hoping he would calm down some after neutering and with a little time, and he hasn’t.

My other cat is so chill that I think I got spoiled and this stuff gets to me sometimes.


Any advice? Aside from these bad habits he’s otherwise a very sweet, EXTREMELY loving, playful, cute lil guy. But all my attempts at training don’t seem to matter and I’m tired of coming home to trash cans knocked over and a puddle of pee on the floor.

701,1668210243,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat is a male DSH and is 1 year old. I adopted him when he was 12 weeks and the shelter told me he wanted to be an only cat. I never have experienced or noticed him being lonely and/or bored until lately (if I’m reading his behavior correctly). There’s an outdoor cat that hangs around outside all the time (yes she has a home and we are friendly with the owner) and he seems to love her. He will stare at her through the window for a long time and check to see if she has come to visit throughout the day. I know he has to like her because he makes little chirp sounds and he gets all perked up. This morning I woke up at 6am to him walking around and just meowing like crazy. He does this at night sometimes, too. 

I am open to getting him a sibling if he would be happier with a friend. I would hate that he wouldn’t be by my side as much, but I do just want him to be thriving.

702,1668210169,self.CatAdvice,True,"My best friend and I adopted a 3 yr old neutered male from a shelter in early September. He was listed as a stray but was definitely someone’s housecat - super calm, obviously well taken care of, etc. He’s a great cat, super quiet, and he did really well with her 2 year old at first.

Now that he’s settled in he’s developed a few weird behaviors. He will cry and cry and cry for food all day long like he’s been starved. He will occasionally try to attack when we’re preparing his food. He’s fed twice a day, mix of wet and dry, in relatively large amounts (slightly more than what’s recommended). We don’t free feed because he will eat until he throws up. It’s like he doesn’t know how to stop. The ONLY toy he will play with is one of those feeder balls with kibble in it. Because he gets food from it. 

He will also get weirdly aggressive for no reason. He’ll be completely chill one minute and with zero warning, bristle up and run at you and pounce with his claws out. He’s gotten my friend’s toddler a couple of times when she’s not even aware he’s there, much less taunting him or doing anything that would trigger an attack. It’ll just come out of nowhere. 

We play with him every day and he has plenty of toys, plus a 6 ft tall cat tree (that he has zero interest in). We’ve tried catnip, different varieties and types of toys, playing more, playing less, etc and nothing seems to be working. He’s super sweet most of the time, we just don’t know what to do about the food motivation and the aggression.

706,1668200082,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello, 

I just adopted an 11 year old black tabby cat from a friend. From what I was told, she is an indoor cat and was having trouble getting along with other cats in the household. 

I've had cats in the past when I was a kid, but they were all outside cats. I live alone and have had no pets until this kitty came along.

I'm not working this week, so pretty much the routine is chill and watch some tv together, be on the computer while she walks around or chills in my lap or her raised bed next to me, play with toys/laser chase, eat treats, sleep in my bed with me when its night time.

I feel like she might really want to go outside. I have a fish pond and she likes to chill on the windowsill and watch them. I want to go out and do yard/pond work, but every time I go to the door, she comes, meows and waits for me to open the door so she can go outside. Maybe it's just because she knows there's fish out there? I'm not sure, but I've been staying inside with her because I feel bad. Her previous owner gave me a harness for outside but she absolutely hates it, she will NOT let me put it on her unless I really force it, which I don't want to do. One suggestion I've been given since she tends to follow me around a lot, (when she's not mad at me over the harness lol) was to just let her outside with nothing, but I'm nervous something could happen. 

Anyway, that's about it. I guess I'm mainly looking for advice or anything else I could do to make sure the cat is happy, engaged and comfortable, especially since it seems like she sleeps a lot...and on top of that, once I go back to work in a few days, she'll be alone for 8-10 hours each work day. I plan on getting her one or two of those multi-level cat towers to start.

709,1668195998,self.CatAdvice,True,"This is something that I never thought I would think of doing in the 10 years I’ve had my cat. Please be kind in the comments. Im in the consideration phase and haven’t made a decision.

My cat is over 10 years old. She’s been with me through many moves, and currently we full time RVing. Have been for some time.

Having her in my home has become extremely stressful and frustrating. I’d like to preface this by saying that she has been to a veterinarian and they informed me that she is in good health.

I’ve always had a problem with her incessant meowing. Meowing for food, meowing at the door to go outside, meowing for no reason at all. It’s not a cute meow. It’s a very loud yowling meow that is like nails on a chalkboard. 

She has a routine for eating once in the morning and once at night, the same as her dog sister. It’s plenty of food maybe even too much as she is slightly overweight. I recently switched back to dry kibble because she stopped eating wet food all together. Originally switched wet food because she stopped eating her Acana kibble. At first she was really enjoying it and then suddenly she just completely stopped eating it. When I started giving her lower quality dry kibble, she proceeded to eat again and we haven’t had issues. I’ve seen her not eat for 2 days before switching foods. 


She is outdoor/indoor, only because I feel awful about having her in a small space. She’ll go outside for about 30 minutes then come back to the door to meow and get in. She’ll even meow at the neighbors doors. Again this is not a cute meow. After letting her in she will be out the door after 15 minutes to go back outside. If I allowed it, she would do this all day.

I brush her every day, I play with her every day, but as soon as that’s done, she will go back to pacing around the house, alternating between meowing at her food bowl, meowing at the door, or just sitting in the middle of the room meowing for no reason.

She constantly tries to get on my chest when I’m laying down and even if I try to gently push her off, she will push back as hard as she can and I have to literally pick her up and put her down. As soon as she touches the ground she jumps back up. She doesn’t simply lay on my chest, she claws into my skin and is persistent about rubbing her nose and a half open mouth on me over and over. It’s really gross I hate it and it’s unhygienic. That’s all she wants to do when she’s trying to lay on my chest she has not interest in laying in my lap or anywhere else that’s easier for me. I’ve tried. More and more she has been keeping me up all night long doing this.

If I’m sitting at my computer, she will jump up and sit on my keyboard. I try to allow her to stay on my desk in front of me where she likes to be but after a while, my back starts to ache, and I have to put her down. Usually she will immediately jump back up again after I put her down to try and resume the position and again persistently push herself into that space while I try to remove her. It’s pretty aggressive.

I have to be careful about how often I let her out because she tends to go through garbage out there and eats it then comes inside to vomit all over the carpet. I also make sure she isn’t out at night because there are some rough stray cats out there at night.

I also have breast reduction surgery coming up soon and I know that she’s going to constantly be trying to get on my chest while I’m healing. And that’s going to be painful. 

I love her, but I can’t help but think that she isn’t getting what she needs here. I can’t even figure out what it is that she needs because I’m giving her everything that I possibly can.  

I’m at my wits end and at a point where I’m actually considering rehoming her so that she can live out the rest of her life somewhere where she can do all the things that she wants to do.  I wish I could explain how aggressive she is when it comes to all of this. It’s not cute, it’s not endearing. It’s over the top and difficult to deal with. It is driving me insane.

Anyway, any perspective or tips for potentially rehoming her would be appreciated. If she did find a place to live I would like to potentially have updates on how she is and potentially contribute to costs to make sure she’s comfortable and happy.",0,Considering re-homing my 10+ yo

However, I truly have nowhere to plug one in. The options include: kitchen counters next to the stove (a bit of a safety hazard), hallway (bound to get knocked over by us in the dark and him with his zoomies), in an extension cord right next to our TV. None of these sound like a good idea to me, and I don’t think running an extension cord to where his dish is currently is a good idea because he loves to chew on cords.

It seems as though all the big brands I typically see people using are plug-ins. I found one battery operated one on Amazon, but it was like $80.

717,1668187102,self.CatAdvice,True,"Let me start by saying I love this little cat outside of the wee hours of the morning. She's sweet and friendly and doesn't make trouble outside of clawing up paper towels, which is easily dealt with.

But because my roommate does not let her into his room overnight, every night for the last few nights (I moved in about two weeks ago) around 2-4am she has started meowing outside my door loid enpugh for me to hear through earplugs, and sticking her paw under the gap between the door and the floor. I know the typical solution is to ignore this until she realizes she won't be rewarded - however, in doing so she wakes up MY cat, who sleeps in my bed at night. I play with him before bed so he normally sleeps through the night, but she wakes him and then they spend anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour batting playfully at each other under the door, after which my boy gets zoomies and keeps me up for another 15-20. So they both get rewarded for the bad behavior, and I get to listen to loud meowing and my door rattling until they settle.

The cats are friendly enough together, and around the same age (mine is 3yrs, his is 1yr) but they don't really play with each other yet, as my boy is still settling in and doesn't feel safe enough to play outside of my room yet.

My roommate is still new to cat ownership and doesn't play with her enough. I know the long term solution is to make him tire her out before bed or at least keep her in his room while he sleeps - but I don't want to sour things between us so soon by pestering him about his cat. But at this point this is affecting my quality of sleep, while he sleeps like a log and doesn't hear any of it even though he's right across the hall. I need a temporary solution until I can impress upon him the importance of engaging his cat.

I was thinking maybe a scat mat (NOT the electric kind, I'm not a monster) for in front of my door so at least, but if she learns to step over it, does anything exist that could keep them from pawing under the door?

720,1668180375,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all.

I have four animals, doggies Blue (13) and Macie (11), and kitties Bristol (6) and Phoenix (3). 

In the past 3 days, Bristol will not stop attacking Phoenix. She acts like she's scared of him, which she's never done. And Phoenix is an orange boy with one braincell, he's the absolute sweetest. He doesn't instigate anything and is not aggressive at all but for whatever reason she won't leave him alone. 

She is not showing aggression to the dogs. When not around him, she doesn't seem like she's in pain or doesn't feel well. I've checked her over for any injuries. They've lived together since Phoenix was a baby. There have been no changes within the house, like routines or moving things around. Everything is normal.

What I think is weird is also in the past 3 days, my dog Blue has been trying to hump Phoenix and also will not leave him alone. (Playfully, no aggression.) Blue has never done this with any animal. He has never shown any... I guess sexual behaviors. 

The cats are both indoor cats. But I'm wondering if Phoenix has gotten into something that's made him smell different or something like that. He and Bristol have their tifts but it never last this long. And the fact that Blue is all over him too is weird. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great! I hate having to keep the kitties separated because that means one has to be by themselves in a room (due to floor plan in the house, there is no other way to separate them, and I hate this.)

So I have two cats and I live in an apartment in a city that is known to have mice/rat problems.

I might have a pest problem in my house and 2. One of my cats ate a rat and left the tail. They never brought a pest to my bed or anything in the past.

732,1668167074,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all hope you can help.

Recently my partner and I moved in together and both brought our respective pets to our new home together. Both cat and dog have never cohabited with the opposite species before.

Dog and cat have been living separately so to speak for the past 2 months with a pet gate separating them. The reason for the gate was firstly for their initial comfort but also my cat is on thyroid meds which I wouldnt want the dog to eat as kitty is a grazer. Secondly- lovely little dog, but does have the au de pupper and sheds like crazy so partner and I agreed he would be a downstairs dog.

My issue is that as kitty has gotten braver over the last two weeks, he is coming to the dog gate and literally boxing the dog through the bars, hissing, yowling, etc. Doggo gets excited and paws through the gate back at him, tail wagging, woofing in excitement.

I break them up as I dont want them to get hurt but is this a part of the adjustment process?

Last night the cat instigated his reign of terror 3 separate times and I caught him slinking back for a 4th before telling him off.

I dont expect them to be besties but am concerned if it continues to escalate in this manner that one or both will get hurt or stressed.

733,1668164031,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone, 

I absolutely adore cats, I think they are beautiful, intelligent and so so soft. Lately, I’ve been looking for a pet to keep me company in my apartment. Its not small, but it’s certainly not as big as a house. Unfortunately, I’ve never owned a cat before because I used to be extremely allergic to them, however over time and exposure, I’ve gradually decreased the severity of my allergy. However, watery eyes and a runny nose are still very much a thing. I also work long hours and travel pretty often. Now, I would be able to get a cat on planes, for long trips, but it would be harder to travel for say a weekend.

I’m looking for a cat that is particularly low maintenance. A breed that can take care of itself for a day or two with a self timed feeder and some toys. A not so energetic cat that won’t mind apartment living, but still doesn’t mind being pet, or watching movies on the couch together. I prefer short haired cats, but I really prefer hypoallergenic cats to save me from overdosing on Benadryl. 

I’ve done some research and Russian Blues seem to be the best bet. Is that correct? Are there other breeds? I love the Russian blue coat and eyes and from videos I’ve seen, I do love their temperament. They seem to be pretty self-reliant but curious and sociable. 

Am I right in this discernment, are there other cats you would recommend. Any tips or suggestions are welcomed.

741,1668141077,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have ADHD, and using squish fidgets (""mini mochi squishies"" is what I think they're called) helps me focus sometimes. Recently, I've noticed one of my cats, Lillian, has been stealing them. 

I keep them on my nightstand so I can grab them when I leave for school in the morning. But ive noticed they've been ending up on the floor, in my bed, and in the hallway. I have a high feeling it's Lillian because she's the only one that really likes to ""hunt"", or grab and make off with things that interest her ig. but I don't know why she would be grabbing my squishes. I've looked them over, and I haven't seen any bite marks on them, and from the very few I have found are from where I assume she's been grabbing them, so I don't think she's been trying to eat them. 

A few days ago, I got curious and held one up to her. She sniffed it a little bit and licked it a few times, but just wanted me to pet her. 

so does anyone have any reason for this behavior? and if so, should I be worried about it? 

additional information if needed: 
- I have two cats, and she's the oldest at 13, and the other at ~8 is a lazy little thing
- I'm pretty certain she's a domestic long-hair, but can't be too sure

746,1668137557,self.CatAdvice,True,"After reading about it, I believe my cat (2 years old, F) has single cat, or single kitten, syndrome. She was rescued by us at only five weeks old when she was rejected by her mother, and didn’t interact with any other cat until she was far older. 

Since she was a kitten she’s had problems with biting, and nothing seems to be able to stop the behaviour - not yelping, not walking away, not distracting her with toys, nothing. I believe that what would have prevented it is having a playmate who could bite back. She was never properly socialized, and I’m wondering if getting another cat could help change her behaviour. 

The problem is, she’s always been aggressive towards other cats any time she’s been around them. I worry that another cat would just cause long term stress if she’s already used to just being around myself and my roommates and not interacting with other cats.

748,1668135262,self.CatAdvice,True,"So, I'm probably going to move out of my parents house soon and move into a shared house with roommates. My mom thinks since it's a smaller space I should one take one cat with me and leave the other one at home with them and she'll make sure to take good care of him. We have two cats, Finn (7m), and Evee (6f). My mom thinks I should just take Evee since she is more of my cat. Evee's favorite person is me and is not really interested in anyone else is our family. She hangs out in my bedroom most of the time and loves to sleep in my bed with me. She often follows me around the house or gets me to follow her. She licks me and just generally wants to be near me most of the time. She is scared of people she doesn't know and sometimes hides from Finn. Finn is super territorial and loud and rude. He's like a jerk in cat form. He has sprayed every couch in the house to claim it as his, despite being neutered. (My mom is concerned that if I take him with me too, he's going to do that again.) He likes to scream, a lot, and he can go for hours without taking a break. (My mom is also concerned he will bother roommates.) He likes to attack Evee, just like randomly or if he's hungry or bored. (She's kind of scared of him and hides from him at times and they just don't coexist in the same room for long periods of time well. Evee stays in my room and Finn is usually downstairs.) Also Finn claims all the cat toys and cat trees. We have 2 cat trees and essentially Finn is only one who uses them because he has decided they are his and Evee can't use them. Sometimes she'll go in the bottom cubby of one of the trees because Finn never goes in there because he's too big. Evee won't really play with toys if Finn is around because he takes them. She only plays in my room. 

BUT I feel like no one in my family really spends time with Finn like I do. He has long hair and needs to be brushed everyday so it doesn't get matted. I'm the one who feeds hims and brushes him and plays with him. No one else does. I want to bring him with me because I love him and I don't know if he'll get the attention he needs at home with my parents. He will miss me and Evee. (I don't think Evee will miss him though).

752,1668130335,self.CatAdvice,True,"I'm looking for help from some animal lovers. My wife and I rent a room in a shared house. When we moved in about two years ago, our landlady was looking for a new cat, and we went with her to pick out Ghost, just a baby kitten at the time. He has always been unofficially ""our cat"" - he is very attached to us, and doesn't want anything to do with our roommates/landlady. He would spend all day cuddling if he could and gets very upset when we leave for work. There is another cat, Grim, who is a bit older and is definitely my landlady's cat. Ghost and Grim get along decently, they play and once in a while nap together. Both cats officially belong to my landlady but they have made their preferences clear. Both cats are indoor cats.

My wife and I are about to move into quite a small apartment. It's a much smaller space and we both work full time out of the home. I want to ask my landlady if we can take Ghost with us. It breaks my heart to think of him looking for us and I love him so much. I really worry how he would be without us because he is so attached. He was separated from his mother very young and still tries to suckle with us. However, it seems cruel to take him away from the other cat, into a much smaller space, where we will be gone all day and the apartment empty. As much as I love him, I want whatever will be best for him. If keeping him alone a lot in an apartment will be worse, I would not ask to adopt him, and would leave him here (very reluctantly+sadly).

I came to Guatemala and plan to be here for 2 months so I can spend the holidays with her and her family. The plan was to go back to LA together along with her dogs. Naturally we both wanted my cat to get along with her two 2-year old maltese mixes so I brought him along, but now that they’ve met and after my Scottish fold was being aggressivley barked at he just seems paranoid. It looked like a classic playground bullying scenario. Now he isnt doing all the things he normally does like eat, drink, play, use the restroom you name it. All he does is hide all day. 

Back at home we have a Pomeranian in the same household and they have no issues. It seems like he has a lot on his mind and I do understand that all this was a lot to take in for him, the new environment, people, animals. Coming into this I completely understood how it was going to be stressful for him but didn’t expect myself to be this worried. 

The dogs seem like they have social issues themselves as well. I’m not dog expert but looks like they run the house. They rarely respond when being called, bark at almost everything (even the maid who lives in the house), follow her everywhere (even into the bathroom), they only let my fiancé and her brother touch them. Yes, it could be a natural instinct for them to feel as if they need to protect her.

774,1668109326,self.CatAdvice,True,"My brother has an Almost 1 year old kitten/cat. When I first got the kitten for him it was fine. Had a sensitivity to a certain brand and went through couple weeks of having diarrhoea at 12 weeks. Was fine after we figured out what the issue was and was peeing and pooping normally in the litter tray until he turned 6 months old. 
My brother is very stressed out at the moment and hoping someone has an answer out there. The cat started off pooping outside the litter box frequently he didn’t completely abandon the box but he would feel comfortable pooping in that one spot like the bathroom. Used enzyme cleaner and everything but still he kept going there then we took the bathroom mat away and he stopped for a couple weeks then went back there even when there was no bathroom mat and began pooping there. This went on for a couple months, vet said he was fine and that it was behavioural. We then found out he had been pooping under the bed. Then he started peeing on the bathroom floor. We put a litter box in the bathroom but still he peed outside the box. So at this point he’s started pooping back in his box and peeing on the bathroom floor. We figured he needed to be neutered but we was also aware that it was a habit by now so we needed to break the habit. He got neutered and we confined him to a room with his litter box, showed him how to use it. We even put two litter boxes one for pee one for poop ( if that’s what the issue was) STILL he pees right outside the box but poops inside the box. So after maybe a month of re training him we let him out and he went and peed in 3 different spots. The litter is soft like sand but it can’t be the litter because he is using it for pooping. The vet said he is healthy but my brother will get a blood test done last resort. Let’s just say the blood test comes back fine? What then? What could this possibly be? What is wrong with him? We have tried calming diffusers, more than one litter box, open litter box, soft litter, litter training, enzyme cleaner each time, big enough litter box. Boxes are scooped daily. Tried different litter.  He gets 1/2 hours of playtime a day and everything he could possibly need as an indoor cat. He is the only cat. Surely it cannot be marking behaviour? He got neutered about 2 months ago. If it was a problem with his bladder then why would he start with pooping inappropriately first then peeing? We have also tried litter attract but it’s like he’s not abandoning his box he’s just peeing in other places but more and more frequently. Is there such a thing as cats having an overreactive bladder? So I don’t know if things like a urinalysis will be of any help. Nothing is working. My brother just keeps spending money on things for the cat to help him or replacing things that the cat has ruined. PLEASE HELP. He was fine until about 6 months ago when it all started and nothing drastically changed for his behaviour to change.

776,1668105900,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello,

I have a super anxious cat. To the point that nothing I did worked. There was been a few post about it here. Long story short she was put on a very low dose of prozac. Two weeks after she is back to herself. 

I am hoping that maybe she can be in it for a year and I can slowly take her off of it. 

While she is doing better I do notice that she will be sleeping and if my fiance starts doing dishes she will get up immediately and make sure it is safe before going back to bed. None of my other 3 cats do this. I do notice that playing music or having some type of noise helps ""masks"" other sounds and she can sleep. This can be very simple sounds, doors opening, etc. And they can be happening far away from the room she is in, and she will still get a bit panicked.

Other than playing more with her (which I have been doing), what else can I do to help her ease her anxiety?

Any tips are highly appreciated 🙏🏻.

777,1668105153,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello Everyone,

I have two lovely cats :) They’ve been with me since the start of the pandemic and so they have only ever known home-life with me. That’s the norm for them - wake up, wake me up, play, eat, and enjoy :)

The problem is that I have to return to work in person next year. I am dreading and feeling anxious about how they will adjust because they’ve been with me for about 2yrs 24/7 together basically all the time. I go out and they have been alone but not long. I realize that I’ve spoiled them and worried about how they will adjust.

My question is, would it be better to have the two of them left home alone for the 9hr work day, and play with them plenty once I am home? Or should I bring them to my parents’ daily so that they have a larger place to roam around and some human interaction? They’re still skittish of my parents and I have brought them over 1-2x a week for the past several weeks to get used to it. They’ll follow me around wherever I go at my parents’ home but they’ll have a bit of fun exploring and climbing and jumping. At our own home, it’s tinier, and they’re content and happy to lounge in their cat tree.

Would it be better to have them be in the comfort of their own home, without company, for 9hrs/5x week? Or would it be better to bring them to my parents’ where they can explore, have human company, but are skittish?

779,1668101041,self.CatAdvice,True,"About 10 months ago, we adopted an 8-month-old former feral from a rescue that keeps their available cats in a pet store. When I observed him and later met him in the common cat room, The Buddy ignored the other cats in the room in favor of me, and later, my husband. He adores humans, and anyone who enters our house is immediately greeted by The Buddy, who's never met a lap he didn't like. My husband and I don't get to travel together a lot, but the few times we have since adopting The Buddy, we had friends and neighbors look in on him three or four times a day, and we're told he was very starved for attention. He showed a little separation anxiety when we returned from a recent (short) trip to see my 81-year-old mom, and I wonder if he might like a friend when we (especially I) can't be around all day like we usually are (we both mostly work from home). 

I've found a 4-month-old female who loves cats more than she loves humans, and she's unbonded. The foster thinks she sounds like a good match for our cat, especially since she won't compete for our attention and she's a beta, so I'd been thinking we'd foster to adopt (I met her and she's so, so sweet). Per advice we read, I brought home a piece of her bedding; the Buddy sniffed it for a long time in a crouched position, then ran upstairs and starting patrolling the house. In doing some reading it sounds like the fact that he didn't hiss or avoid the smell is at least not a negative sign, but I'm super stressed about the introductions (I use Jackson Galaxy as my guide, so we're going with the separate-room plan) and the tension I saw in his body language.

For some background, my partner and I have a female cat, Luna, who we have had since 2019. She's about four years old. She's a tiny cat, is very friendly, but can be a bit timid. She used to live with an elderly (18 yr old) male cat and got along quite well with him before he passed. Back in June, we opted to adopt a second cat and brought home our new addition, Mochi. Mochi is a two year old female, who is extremely outgoing and friendly with people. She is also significantly larger than Luna. We did slow introductions for months, with each introduction stage successful, until they are unsupervised. When given the chance, Mochi stalks and charges at Luna, which ultimately terrifies her. Luna is not typically the aggressor, but will hiss whenever she notices signs of Mochi's incoming aggression. In thinking about it, it's really difficult for us to know if Mochi is instigating play, or actually aims to hurt Luna. Either way, Luna interprets all of her advances as a threat. It has been about 6 months since our initial adoption, and we have not been able to curb the stalking behavior. I have personally always owned cats, but have only introduced kittens to adult cats, and have not ever attempted to introduce two adult cats. We would be so grateful for any thoughts or advice on this behavior!

785,1668097710,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I have two babies, brother and sister, both neutered, age 7 years, they get along really well and love each other so much.

I am moving from Italy to the UK with my boyfriend and it's going to involve a long car trip. I've read loads about the best way to car travel with cats, but we are still uncertain about some details and what would be best for them. To be honest, I am really anxious because I want them to be as fine as possible.

To give a bit of background... They already moved twice, but each time it was just an hour drive. The first time was when I moved at my boyfriend's, then we stayed there for about a year; after that, the cats and I moved back with my mum but in a new house, and now after six months, we are going to join my boyfriend in the UK. They don't like moving, but the second move was better than the first one, they got used to the new place way faster. Instead, the second drive was a bit worse: they meowed all the time and Grey pissed himself. Between this two moves, we had to get them to a special vet for their passport, each drive back and forth was 30 mins, and going there Grey pissed and shit himself. The vet carrier is different than the ""move"" carrier, just to be clear. So, yes, Grey is the one that gets more stressed.

We found what we think would work best for them: staying in a carrier together (when they are together they are way more relaxed, even during a car travel), but they will have enough room to stay away from each other if they want to; I will sit in the back with them as we found that helps too; there is some cat music they particulary enjoy; we will use feliway too; and the vet prescribed us a relaxant. I am harness training them, and Grey is at a really good point, so maybe we will have also that option - I know some cats prefer to travel with the harness and leash on without being in the carrier, but I am not sure we will get to that point.

Our real dilemma - the reason of this post - is how to structure the drive itself. It is a 17 hr drive, with normal traffic and without considering pauses, so let's say 20. We are okay doing it in one go, and initially we thought it was maybe best for them - as they don't like new places generally - but now I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to stop for the night somewhere and do two shorter drives. I am afraid that in one go, they wouldn't use the litter and I don't want them to get an UTI.   
Grey just had struvite and calcium oxalate crystals one month ago, probably due to stress; he is totally fine now, he is taking a med (STIEN in Italy) to prevent it and they are also both eating the urinary care food. She had an UTI 2 years ago, non stress related. But you can see why I worry about this.

My wife and I went on a trip for ten days. Luckily my mom lives close enough that she was able to watch my cat while we were gone.

We assumed it was anxiety, but had him checked out with the vet when we returned just in case it was something else. The results came back normal.

This was a month and a half ago. Pretty much everyday we find a pee spot in the living room and it's starting to stain the hardwood. His litter box is being cleaned at least once a day, so we know it's not in reaction to a messy box. We've been spraying pheromones. There's been no major household or dietary changes for him.

Today he did the unthinkable and did it on the couch.

788,1668095042,self.CatAdvice,True,"We've had Freddy since he was a kitten. Even then he was never super snuggly, preferring to play and explore more than anything else. If course, if he was tired, he might sleep in your arms. But he didn't actively seek affection.

At about a year he started becoming affectionate. He would rub against your legs or hand, flop down and roll over to ask for belly rubs and you got to hear him purr a couple times a day anyway. He still wasn't like that all the time but you got enough of it. We used to pick him up all the time and while he didn't want to be held too long, he seemed content with it. Every once in a while he would purr a little while held, maybe knead on our arm a bit. I was happy with that.

But now, getting closer to two years, he's going back to preferring to be alone it seems. If he sees you, he'll raise his tail and you can pet his head a couple times and he clearly likes it. But no purrs, no flopping. If you pick him up, he goes stiff and will generally give a meow in protest within seconds. He seems FAR more prone right now to getting upset to the point of attacking. The only real times he seeks out affection now are when we go to the bathroom (he NEEDS to come in and he'll be all love-y for about 30 seconds) or when we go to bed he will come up between us, flop down and purr and be 100% affection. If we didn't have that, I'd be much more upset.

We did get a new kitten about a month ago which I could see contributing to his general curmudgeon-ness but his behavior started before that.

I'm not sure if there are any steps I can be taking to try to convince my Freddy to be a little more affectionate. If this is simply who he is then I can accept that - we'll love him all the same.

792,1668086190,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have had both my cats for seven years (adopted the male Milo at about one year old, the female Cordelia a few months later as a kitten).  Over the years it has become apparent that Cordelia does not enjoy socializing with Milo.  Milo is very friendly and energetic and Cordelia is more low key and not terribly playful.  I tend to see Cordelia as the dominant cat, as she always eats first (they have separate automatic feeders and when one goes off first she moves him right over without any protest), always gets the spot she wants, etc.  Over the past few months, Milo has increasingly wanted to play with Cordelia, but Cordelia is getting more and more irritated.  Milo is not showing any bullying behavior in the slightest and has never been aggressive, but will simply not get the hint when Cordelia gives him signals to back off, so she has resorted to hissing and batting, and has recently started to get extremely anxious and avoidant (going into the shower to poop even though they have two litter boxes in completely separate places, hiding), and they had their first full blown fight the other day because Cordelia attacked him.  I have spent so much time playing with Milo to try to get it out of his system, but all he wants to do is play with Cordelia, and I am at a total loss at this point as to what to do to curb his behavior because it is constant.  My next plan is to take Cordelia to the vet and see if there’s a medical issue contributing to her irritability and try to build up the cat architecture in my apartment as much as I can so that she has more places to run off to, but I’m more concerned about the fact that Milo will simply just not get the hint.

I live in Estonia so there isn't usually a massive selection of different cat foods at more stores (for a reasonable price). My cat can be quite picky with most foods, flavors, even wet she will only eat the liquid etc. The one food she has seemed to enjoy for the last couple of years is Purina One Bifensis (beef flavour), but I recently came across a more natural/heathier looking brand for not much more money. I don't know much about grain free or cat nutrition but this new one seems better to me. I just wanted to know if it was worth the extra cost (only 15-20%).

Purina One:

**Ingredients:**  
Beef (16%), dried poultry protein, wheat (14%), soya meal, maize, maize gluten meal, animal fat, wheat gluten meal, dried beet pulp, dried chicory root, minerals, digest (with added heat treated Lactobacillus Delbrueckii and Fermentum powder 0.025%), yeast.

808,1668059511,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 4.5 month old kitten two weeks ago. He is very sweet, cuddly, and energetic! I am having so many mixed feelings about him though. **TLDR at the bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

To start, the kitten has done nothing wrong. But some issues have come up. I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

1.  I have a 15 year old blind dog, and although the kitten seems to like him and is actually trying to rub against him, my dog is not liking it. Bubba has a very sweet temperament and does not have an aggressive bone in his body.  But he has severe separation anxiety, and I was hoping that another animal in the house would help, but it has actually made it worse. I though Bubba was scared at first, but it seems like he genuinely does not like the kitten. Him being blind also means that he can't see the kitten and his body language. We've had many instances with the kitten wanting to play with bubba, or even getting aggressive with bubba because he isn't paying attention to him. I can tell that bubba is getting increasingly stressed and is not liking our situation at all. I've had him since he was a puppy, and I know him well enough to say that him warming up to the kitten would take more than time. I honestly think that Bubba might be jealous or something...
2. Time is also another issue. I already knew that kitten would have a lot of energy, so I tried to prepare to be available to play with him for around four or five 15-30 minute increments throughout the day. But even after we are done playing, he seems to keep bouncing off the walls. During these times he also is attacking bubba out of excitement. He is so cute, and I enjoy playing with him sometimes, but most of the time it feels like a chore. As time goes on it is becoming harder and harder for me to enjoy playing with him and giving him attention... I feel so terrible saying that when he is so sweet and he can't help his energy level! 
3. I've noticed patchy rashes on my legs that appears to be contact dermatitis. I am very prone to skin allergies, so I take a morning and a night allergy medication and I have learned what causes my allergies so I only use skin products that I know I'm not allergic to. I noticed these rashes a couple days after getting the kitten, and I can't say for certain but I think I might be allergic to him... I haven't changed anything in my routine except for him. I'm really sad just thinking about the possibility that I am allergic.
4. This isn't fair to the kitten, and I don't really know why I'm adding this, but I have a lot of plants that I care about and I am so scared that he is either going to get sick from them or he is going to kill them. I am currently in the process of segregating most of them to one room and hanging the rest up high. But from what my friends have told me about cats, its that they will find a way to get up there if they are motivated enough. He has already managed to get on top of my fridge! I really can't give away or sell most of my plants since they are family heirlooms...

**TLDR: Overall the biggest reasons I am on the fence is because my blind senior dog seems to be really stressed and shows no signs of warming up, and I am developing skin rashes possibly because I am allergic to the kitten. I know that people say that time will tell, but I don't want to make the kitten grow more attached to us and have him suffer by taking him back to the shelter. But after doing a lot of research I am also worried about the kitten not finding a good home to adopt him. I just really don't know what to do. I keep thinking that our lives would be back to normal and be easy and calm again. But I feel so guilty for thinking that way. I want to believe that he would find a good home since he is so sweet and cuddly, but I have no way to know...**

&amp;#x200B;

*I am going to try to go to the doctor soon to try and see if I'm allergic to cats or maybe something else (liter maybe?). And if I'm not, and I decided to take the kitten back to the rescue, would it be stupid of me to try to adopt an older cat instead? I thought that a kitten would better adapt to our home, but now I'm thinking that maybe Bubba would warm up to an adult cat more? I don't know though. If anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice.*",0,"I can't seem to make a decision regarding the kitten I adopted.

1. he CONSTANTLY is play-attacking my hands and feet. Like, I can't even get up without him pouncing and his energy bursts last hours. I've always been trying to redirect his attention and hand him toys, but he still prefers my hands and feet. I've also tried letting out little yelps, but to no avail. How do I curb this habit? I've read that ""ignoring"" works, but what does that mean? just let him bite? 
2. I'm slightly discouraged by all the research I'm doing about single cats. It makes me feel like I'm gonna grow up with a lonely, aggressive cat no matter what I do unless I adopt a companion. Can I hear some success stories from someone about a single kitty who outgrew the biting kitten phase and is doing just fine? 
3. Theres been 3 occasions where he's done a short ""Hiss"" at me while playing. Is that normal? I don't know if I can classify it as a hiss but I don't know what else to call it

812,1668055572,self.CatAdvice,True,"Starting note: I actually have three cats, but the third (Harley) isn't super relevant here; she doesn't get along super great with either of my other two but she mostly ignores them so it's not a big deal.

This is about my other two cats - Asuka (female, 4, spayed, tuxedo) and Gawain (male, 4, neutered, white). Asuka has always had anxiety issues but they've skyrocketed since we adopted Gawain, to the point where she's sequestered herself to the second floor of our apartment and we've had to start feeding her separately because she won't come down even for food. 

Gawain was found on the streets with a number of injuries, sad and hurting, and immediately attached himself to us. We helped him recover. He has never been anything but sweet to Asuka; when she hisses at him he sits down and slow blinks at her. He tries to play with her occasionally, which she hates. If he dares to come anywhere near her she hisses, swats, scratches; when we're out of the house and can't separate them sometimes we'll come home to find he has a new scratch on his ear or nose.

Asuka was our first cat together; we've had her for almost her whole life. Feliway doesn't help. We've been considering taking her to the vet for possible anxiety medication because her anxiety levels around Gawain are just not rational. And she's hurting him, and that's hardly fair to him.

This has turned into a ramble - basically, I love both of these cats and they are both incredibly attached to us. Rehoming either is not an option.

813,1668055458,self.CatAdvice,True,"I’m going to the vet first thing in the morning, but I thought I’d ask here because I’m a pretty new cat owner and I haven’t experienced this. My new cat is a 1 year and 3mo old male, and he has his own room while I introduce him to my 4 yo female. 

Yesterday I noticed him crouching strangely, but thought nothing of it, and today I got home to little drops of pee all around the room, with his litter box full of scattered little pees. I put him in the bathroom temporarily to clean up, and he was still leaking on the bathroom floor, as though he was incontinent, but he’s still a baby :(

He’s eating and drinking and behaving normally, it just looks like he can’t hold it in, and like he constantly needs to go, like maybe a UTI? 

I’ve had some trouble with introducing the two cats these past 2 months as well, as he seems more dominant than my older cat and likes to swat at her when I have them interact. He also doesn’t like being stuck in the room even though I let him explore the house everyday, he scratches at the door and I know not to give him attention when he does that, I don’t know when he’ll get the message that it doesn’t work, I just hope I’m doing things correctly :’)

My male cat is about 9 months old and he hasn't been neutered yet(moving, timing and costs), he's also pretty big for his age, I'd say a pound or 3 more than the average cat his age. he's always been affectionate more so than any cat I've met, more like a dog. He loves cuddles, specifically when he's got his two front arms wrapped around my neck like a hug and I hold him in my arms, he also gives kisses. At first I thought maybe it was the smell of food on my mouth because that's where he likes to lick, basically only my lips unless he can't get to them then he licks my face.

837,1668033406,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 3F Tabby about a month ago. I was told she was a lap cat at the SPCA, which is an understatement. I WFH, which I thought would be good for pet ownership, but has almost made things worse with a cat who clearly has separation anxiety. She wants to be on me all day. The first few days, I allowed it, but she freaked out when bed time came and I closed my bedroom door/went to bed without her. Yowling most of the night ensued. After lots of reading, I implemented all the recommended changes, including creating a boundary of staying away from me while I’m working to build comfort with being alone, which she’s picked up on well. Things have improved a bit at night, but she still my yowls for about 45 minutes after I go into my room. I would normally be ok with this, but I live in an apartment complex and fear noise complaints coming. 

My question: should I try just letting her sleep with me?

839,1668029818,self.CatAdvice,True,"My wife and I just adopted a kitten that's somewhere between 2-3 weeks old (mother couldn't be found and it was crying in the rain) we've seen a vet and got some advice from them, but I still had some more questions.

Just to lay out her situation: We took her to a vet within 30 minutes of receiving her, the vet wiped her once and she let out so much that the vet was shocked, but said it seems she's starting to get it all out and she should be okay, but to come back if she has any stomach issues. She also received a dewormer.

She's been bottle fed the last 3 days (tomorrow is scheduled to be her first day on wet food + KMR formula mixed according to the vet) 

Her sleep situation is we have a walk in closet separate from any of our other animals, we have her in a box in there with a puppy pad and a fluffy blanket, so the ambient temperature is higher than the main house and she can stay warm.

Questions:

1) Her butt has been pretty red since that initial wiping at the vet (and following huge expel) - is this okay? It seems _less_ inflamed but I'm worried Im just inflaming it more when I wipe her.

2) For wiping her so she can go to the restroom, how long should we wipe? We've been trying to use baby wipes, are these okay? I bought cat wipes but they say ""not for internal use"" which worried me about wiping her with them.

I don't wanna wipe too long and inflame her even longer, but I also don't want her stuffed up cause I didn't do it right.

Our vet instructed us to do it once per meal, and so far she pees after every meal but doesn't poop most the time 
(maybe 1-2 times a day? sometimes in her box, even though she didnt go during a feeding, which requires cleaning everything out and remaking it)

3) When she cries for food, we feed her, and she'll usually drinks a lot which is good, but then she stops. 

She then starts sitting there crying, but if we give her the bottle back she maybe suckles a tiny bit then spits it out again. 

Holding her doesnt seem to help, and neither does letting her walk around a bit seemingly, if we put her back in her box and in the warm closet she'll cry MUCH louder and climb towards us until we close the door and let her cry herself out - she then falls asleep.

Is anything wrong with that? I can't find info on kittens in this age group crying beyond ""They cry for food"" but she doesn't want the food, so I'm just not sure what else to do but get her to sleep?

4) Is there anything stimulating we should be doing for her? 

Right now the process has been:
Wait until 3-4 hours has passed since last feeding, or she cries -&gt; Feed her until she stops accepting the bottle -&gt; try and let her walk around or climb on us a bit to work on her muscles and coordination -&gt; put her back in her box in the closet and let her sleep till next feeding or she cries again

Is there anyway we should be playing with her? or stimulating her? I want her to learn how to walk and play when she's supposed to, and she seems interested in walking around, but she's also uncoordinated and falls over a lot, and shakes when she holds herself up too long.

5) Her back legs/tail are kinda grimy, they feels wet most the time and have that sorta ""stiff"" feeling.

I took a washcloth and some unscented dawn to it and its a tiny bit better, but not ideal, is there anything better I could be doing?

My cat gets fed from the auto feeder 3x a day, and some wet food at night (all small portions, I’ve done the calorie math).

They told me that they noticed that my cat wouldn’t eat from the kibble bowl sometimes so we kinda chalked it up to separation anxiety from me.

Now she’s avoiding her kibble altogether, so I’ve been adding some cat-safe tuna/chicken toppings to entice her to eat but she’ll kinda fish around her bowl. 

I read online that it could be dental pain, but she’s still eating her wet food and hard treats just fine.

844,1668022372,self.CatAdvice,True,"As the title says, my new cat is not affectionate at all. To give some context, my bf had a British shorthair since she was a kitten until she was about 1 years old. Due to work and other personal reasons, he decided to give her away. He stayed in contact with the person who took his cat and we suspect she wasn’t the nicest to the cat (periodically asking him to take her back but only if he paid a lot of money etc). After months of discussing with my bf about taking her back, he finally did so after the two of them spent 2 years apart. 

As I’m writing this she’s somewhere upstairs roaming around the house on her first days here. She is very shy with us, refuses to be pet or picked up. However, she does come when we call her name so I take that as a good sign? She seems quite curious about us and always watches us if we do something.

I think I’ve been lucky until now because I’ve only had extremely cuddly and affectionate cats and now I have no idea how to act around her. I know we’re still in the beginning but I’m just worried that she’ll never get to truly like us and let her pet her, let alone sleep in our lap or do anything remotely affectionate.

847,1668017801,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all. I have a 1 yo female cat named Peanut and my bf has a 5 yo female cat named Martini. BF and Martini moved into my house a little over 2 months ago and our cats are still not getting along.

We kept Martini in a bedroom by herself when she first came over and still do bc of the issues we’re having. We did the Jackson Galaxy method of introduction. 

We’ve gotten to a point where both cats can be in the same room together and things mostly go well. They can both sit on the couch in peace. They were even face to face the other day (although that ended with Martini hissing, but I believe she is scared of Peanut). We give them treats and play with Peanut (Martini is not very interested in toys). 

Here’s our issue - anytime Martini gets off of the couch and starts walking around/goes outside the bedroom to explore, Peanut stares her down and chases her. Martini runs to hide under another couch and will hiss and growl at Peanut. There has been swatting/hissing on both sides but so far no major fighting with fur flying/blood. 

I try to use treats or toys to distract Peanut when I see her staring Martini down but 9/10 times it doesn’t last long and she ends up chasing. We have tried calming treats and spray - that didn’t work. Currently trying a calming collar on Peanut but so far I haven’t seen a huge difference. 

We’re both at our wits end. It seems like Peanut is being aggressive and chases her down to attack her. It’s like she’s saying to Martini “Hey why are you going out there? That’s my territory.” We feel bad for Martini having to mostly be confined to this bedroom when she clearly wants to go out and explore, but we are too afraid of them fighting for real. We don’t know how much, if any, interactions either cat had with other cats before. One of my thoughts is maybe Peanut was never taught how to properly interact with other cats. 

Are we overreacting? Is this just normal behavior? Do we need to restart the intro process? Both cats have been to the vet in recent months and are fine. We don’t know what else to try.

854,1668005237,self.CatAdvice,True,"TLDR: Outdoor boy cat is stressing out our formerly outdoor girl cat - should we adopt out the boy cat, or is there a better solution?

Some backstory: About six months ago, 5 kittens turned up in our backyard (2 boys, 3 girls). We successfully TNR’d all 5 babies, and have been feeding them twice daily ever since. The 2 boys and 1 of the girls have been extremely affectionate and accepting of human interaction since day one. 
About a month ago, one of the boys went missing and hasn’t returned. We think he was able to find a family that took him in with them and now he’s living the good life indoors. 
With one cat down, we began becoming very attached to these cats, the most being with the runt of the pack, one of the girls. The other boy was just as affectionate - they would come into our sun room every night for pets and snuggles. While they should be technically deemed feral cats, they never struck us as such, because they were so accepting of human touch and would come up to us with no hesitation. 
Our favorite, the runt girl, all of a sudden turned up with a scrape on her nose. This sent us into a tizzy and, in order to prevent her nose getting any worse, she was moved indoors with us. She’s now been to the vet, her nose is fully healed, and she’s a new member of our family. 
Since she has come inside to live with us, the remaining boy has begun yowling outdoors at night. He has scaled our house to get to our bedroom windowsill, and hangs from the screens on our window on our sunroom, all while meowing very loudly. It’s very distressing for both our cat and us. We thought perhaps they just missed each other, so we let him back into our sunroom so they could be together, but they didn’t show any interest in being together. It seems that he just wants to be inside with us as well - I’m not sure if the yowling is territorial or jealous.

My question is - do you think it would be okay at this point to try and adopt the boy out? Or would it cause more harm than good? I think he is destined for the indoor life and would be great at it. At this time we are not able to accommodate them both living inside with us. Or is there a different solution we should consider? Would no longer feeding them encourage to move on from our yard?

855,1668005111,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi everyone, my cat Pigeon and I just moved two weeks ago. The first night we were here I kept her in a bathroom until she used the litter box and then allowed her into my room. Cue the stoping of the litter box usage. 
Once she peed on my bed I knew it was a UTI and she has gotten her antibiotics from the vet ( they did a urinalysis to confirm). I had her in the bathroom again during the waiting period to have the sample tested and such. 
After getting her antibiotics she used the litter box again that day. So I put her back in my room and allowed her to wander around the house (supervised) for a little bit. At bedtime I put her in my room with me and then woke up to her peeing on her couch, so I moved her back to the bathroom with her litter box- the litter box had been moved to my room. 

This morning l went to the bathroom and she had peed in the litter box since putting her in the bathroom with it. Do I need to just keep her in the bathroom for a few days to allow her time to settle down? I can’t keep the litter box in that bathroom forever, it’s too small of a bathroom for it as is and it’s the only one with a working shower right now. 

She also hasn’t been pooping in her box, but she did that the last time we moved too. If I have to pick up anything I’d rather it be poop.

857,1668003935,self.CatAdvice,True,"Me again, sorry for rapid posting but I had another question regarding Friday, our 5 month old tuxedo cat.

So as I mentioned, she's at the age where she's super into everything and still has that kitten energy. She'll get zoomies and run around the house, meowing like crazy, which is a good sign she needs to be played with. I work from home so I try to play with her fairly consistently, 2 times a day about 30-45 minutes per session with food immediately after. Lately though, I found she's been pretty uninterested with her wand and prefers a laser pointer.

I bought a retractable wand off Amazon and it came with a ton of attachments. I've also just buy her new ones whenever I see them so needless to say we have a ton to work with. I have feathers, worms, mice, and even a bee. And for a little bit, she'll love it. She'll stalk it, chase it, I let her catch it; usual stuff. But after maybe after 2-3 play sessions she'll just have no interest in it whatsoever. She'll just casually walk away and play with something else while I'm standing here, trying my hardest to convince her this is prey.

We also bought her a laser pointer toy, which both me and my girlfriend were a little skeptical at first. We've both heard it messes with cat's heads since they physically can't catch a dot so it might be frustrating for them. Originally I bought it as a tool, rather than a toy. Jackson Galaxy mentioned that it's good to ""wind-up"" cats to play with physical toys, which is what I'd try to do. I'd also use it as a redirection toy, something to take away her attention from something I don't want her to play with. But after being fed up with her not playing with the wand, I whipped out the laser pointer and got her to play for a solid session. She looked satisfied, was panting and purring, and like I said it was the most consistently engaged I've seen her play in a while. The thing is I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should continue to use the laser over wand. To put it bluntly I feel like I'm giving her the kitten playtime equivalent to crack, just feels extreme and I don't want her sense of play to be warped because of it.

My question is what alternatives to the wand that are still remote (cat on one end, me on the other) would you recommend? I think the message Friday's sending to me is that she's bored of the wand, but I know if supplementing it with kitty crack (laser pointer) is the right way to go.",0,Kitten prefers laser pointer over wand,text,465,"['kitten', 'prefers', 'laser', 'pointer', 'wand', 'sorry', 'rapid', 'posting', 'another', 'question', 'regarding', 'friday', '5', 'month', 'old', 'tuxedo', 'catso', 'mentioned', 'shes', 'age', 'shes', 'super', 'everything', 'still', 'kitten', 'energy', 'shell', 'get', 'zoomies', 'run', 'around', 'house', 'meowing', 'like', 'crazy', 'good', 'sign', 'need', 'played', 'work', 'home', 'try', 'play', 'fairly', 'consistently', '2', 'time', 'day', '3045', 'minute', 'per', 'session', 'food', 'immediately', 'lately', 'though', 'found', 'shes', 'pretty', 'uninterested', 'wand', 'prefers', 'laser', 'pointeri', 'bought', 'retractable', 'wand', 'amazon', 'came', 'ton', 'attachment', 'ive', 'also', 'buy', 'new', 'one', 'whenever', 'see', 'needle', 'say', 'ton', 'work', 'feather', 'worm', 'mouse', 'even', 'bee', 'little', 'bit', 'shell', 'love', 'shell', 'stalk', 'chase', 'let', 'catch', 'usual', 'stuff', 'maybe', '23', 'play', 'session', 'shell', 'interest', 'whatsoever', 'shell', 'casually', 'walk', 'away', 'play', 'something', 'else', 'im', 'standing', 'trying', 'hardest', 'convince', 'preywe', 'also', 'bought', 'laser', 'pointer', 'toy', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'skeptical', 'first', 'weve', 'heard', 'mess', 'cat', 'head', 'since', 'physically', 'cant', 'catch', 'dot', 'might', 'frustrating', 'originally', 'bought', 'tool', 'rather', 'toy', 'jackson', 'galaxy', 'mentioned', 'good', 'windup', 'cat', 'play', 'physical', 'toy', 'id', 'try', 'id', 'also', 'use', 'redirection', 'toy', 'something', 'take', 'away', 'attention', 'something', 'dont', 'want', 'play', 'fed', 'playing', 'wand', 'whipped', 'laser', 'pointer', 'got', 'play', 'solid', 'session', 'looked', 'satisfied', 'panting', 'purring', 'like', 'said', 'consistently', 'engaged', 'ive', 'seen', 'play', 'thing', 'im', 'still', 'fence', 'whether', 'continue', 'use', 'laser', 'wand', 'put', 'bluntly', 'feel', 'like', 'im', 'giving', 'kitten', 'playtime', 'equivalent', 'crack', 'feel', 'extreme', 'dont', 'want', 'sense', 'play', 'warped', 'itmy', 'question', 'alternative', 'wand', 'still', 'remote', 'cat', 'one', 'end', 'would', 'recommend', 'think', 'message', 'friday', 'sending', 'shes', 'bored', 'wand', 'know', 'supplementing', 'kitty', 'crack', 'laser', 'pointer', 'right', 'way', 'go']",kitten prefers laser pointer wand sorry rapid posting another question regarding friday  month old tuxedo catso mentioned shes age shes super everything still kitten energy shell get zoomies run around house meowing like crazy good sign need played work home try play fairly consistently  time day  minute per session food immediately lately though found shes pretty uninterested wand prefers laser pointeri bought retractable wand amazon came ton attachment ive also buy new one whenever see needle say ton work feather worm mouse even bee little bit shell love shell stalk chase let catch usual stuff maybe  play session shell interest whatsoever shell casually walk away play something else im standing trying hardest convince preywe also bought laser pointer toy girlfriend little skeptical first weve heard mess head since physically cant catch dot might frustrating originally bought tool rather toy jackson galaxy mentioned good windup play physical toy id try id also use redirection toy something take away attention something dont want play fed playing wand whipped laser pointer got play solid session looked satisfied panting purring like said consistently engaged ive seen play thing im still fence whether continue use laser wand put bluntly feel like im giving kitten playtime equivalent crack feel extreme dont want sense play warped itmy question alternative wand still remote one end would recommend think message friday sending shes bored wand know supplementing kitty crack laser pointer right way go
858,1668003645,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hey everyone, I am having an issue with my cat scooting and not sure how to address it. 

For context, she is a healthy, 2 year old orange tabby. Back in February, she started pooping outside of the litter box, mostly on rugs. I took her to the vet and they didn’t find any issues, said it was behavioral. It lasted for a few months and was quite frustrating because I didn’t know why she started doing this. I changed her food, moved the litter box, got a bigger litter box, etc.. all the things I researched that could solve the issue, I tried. Nothing seemed to work. I took her to the vet again and they did a deeper analysis; still nothing was wrong with her. I ended up having to get rid of all the rugs in my apartment and switched to a cat-attracting litter, and that seemed to work. She now goes in the litter box consistently, yay! 

However, she is still having an issue with scooting. After she goes in the litter box, she will wipe her butt on my blankets/couch/floor.. mostly in soft spots (blankets on my bed 😞). She never used to do this before she started having the litter box issues. It really seems like she just doesn’t want to clean her butt herself anymore. 

Anyone know what could be going on and how to fix it?

We have two area rugs and most of the time they are almost completely covering with cat toys, tunnels and beds, and lots and lots of cat scratchers.

862,1667998840,self.CatAdvice,True,"Now before any judgement, I normally would love my cat (Remi) to be outside free to roam, but unfortunately certain circumstances mean it's not really possible anymore. I live on the ground floor of an apartment building, I don't have a garden but do have a small patio. Remi appeared as a stray on my patio last June asking for food. Over the days she kept coming back and it'd became apparent she'd adopted me and my partner. We quickly learnt that the neighbours next door had abandoned her after their dog tried to attack the cat, they also mistreated her and made no effort to get Remi to return. We slowly adjusted her to our apartment and initially she'd spend a few hours inside and the rest of the day outside (sadly though we live near a busy street that's filled with rats, so it already wasn't the safest).

We adjusted her to indoor life by slowly trusting her alone, and giving her lots of attention and letting her sleep during the day. Then we would keep her inside during work hours because it tends to get rainy in autumn. What made me realise she should be kept indoors fully though was aside from the fact we realised the places she'd go to were kind of filthy, we also caught her a few times nearly crawling inside the open window of those awful neighbours who almost got her killed (this became especially common the last week or so).

The first time we tried to keep her inside at night was in July, but she kept meowing/crying which made us relent and let her go outside. But last night was the first night she stayed inside 24 hours, and although she did meow a few times, she would usually after 5 minutes just move on and relax as if she didn't care anymore. I did stuff like play with her, allow her to climb and roam the apartment, as well as putting livestreams of birds and mice on the TV to help stimulate her. And I was able to sleep the whole night without any disturbance from her.

He’s an orange 2.75 y/o rescue, named Chip. The issue is that he is extremely good driven (there’s no leave for later with him), and wants food all the time.

Currently, the morning food is split into two servings about 40 minutes apart. I’m debating starting even earlier with the smallest possible portion and spacing them out, but I also don’t want him to be used to the idea that food comes at 4am.

871,1667978295,self.CatAdvice,True,"We thought it would have been a good idea to get a new kitten (Oliver) to be a companion for my 10 years old cat (Sophie); we also have a big house which felt kinda empty, so this also played in our decision to adopt a kitten. We picked a cat of the opposite sex in hopes this would recude intial hostility. 
We are following ""introducing a new kitten"" protocols: Oliver has its own room for now where he sleeps and spends parts of the day. He's been here less than a week and I know it takes time, especially with a cat that has established routines and a certain character like Sophie - she is very quiet, likes to nap, while Oliver at 3 months old is a savage.
I would say it's not even going bad: when we are home and can supervise them, Sophie is always overseeing what he does as he plays and randomly runs around, the hissing and the growling on her part are tuning down as well and she is starting to relax a little (aka going back to sleep, sort of) if he doesn't get too close.
I'd like to add that this is what the vet told us to do - after the first 3-4 days where Oliver has stayed mostly in his room, where all of his needs are met of course, to let them interact and just let it sort itself out.

The doubt I have and the reason for me to ask for advice is this: whenever Oliver decides it's time to force socialization, he'll try to play with Sophie by hiding and doing little ambushes and following her around; Sophie responds to this by hissing and trotting away, pissed; she swatted at him only a couple times, no claws involved. Considering how she reacts, would you say this'll fix itself over time or do we need to change strategy? Most of all, is this too stressful for Sophie? The moment he's gone to his room she is back to being our laid back vocal Sophie.

872,1667978022,self.CatAdvice,True,"Here's the story:

Last summer when it was warm one night I had the door open, and a kitten came into my house.  I didn't know whose it was but it looked healthy, so I gave it a little tuna and let it stay with me for awhile.  It left in the early am, a few weeks went by and then I saw it in my neighbor's window.  The window was closed but soon after they started leaving it open in the day so the cat could go outside.

After awhile he started popping up again occasionally at my place when I left my door open, usually just to say hi and walk around a bit.  Sometimes I give him treats, he isn't overweight and he's quite vocal when he wants one.  But I also noticed sometimes he'd be meowing outside my next door neighbor's door (not the cat owner) looking to get invited in by them as well.  Since I often leave my own door open for air flow, when I hear him meowing even if my door is shut I'll open it and see if he wants to come in.  He usually hangs out for awhile checking out the corners and nooks then leaves.

Lately he's been doing it a lot more often.  Last night it was pouring rain and barely above freezing.  I normally never see him in the evenings, I assumed he went home to his family and a warm bed.  But it was very late (after midnight) and he was meowing so miserably so I let him in to get warm.  He pretty much instantly jumped on my couch and nestled between my legs on top of my blanket, where he stayed until morning.  I left the door open for him even though it was cold, and he left just before dawn.

The next day I asked a different neighbor who said the cat gets left out every night.  He was at my door again tonight and much earlier, so once again I let him in and he jumped on the couch to purr and take a nap while nestled against me for warmth.  Now he's fast asleep in my armchair and I plan to give him a safe space to sleep out of the elements whenever he wants.

It clearly wants a nice place to be comfy at night, but is giving shelter to someone else's cat like the pet version of home wrecking?  I don't feel bad at all, if anything I think the owners are not doing a good job by forcing it outdoors especially in bad weather.

While for the most part he’s doing it to initiate play, I am extremely consistent in not rewarding him with any attention. For a month I tried firm NO, walk away, ignore. No luck.

876,1667970064,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a 16.5yr old cat with CKF and CHF. I know this sounds bad, our vet has kind of been pushing to have us put him down asap, but we don't believe it's quite the time yet. He sleeps, eats, drinks, poops, and pees quite normally, some weight loss (he is 9lbs). The problem is he is a very active cat, he likes to sleep with us so he keeps jumping on and off the bed (we have a ramp but he doesn't use it all the time), he likes to be with his humans so if we go downstairs and upstairs, he follows. He also likes to play his scratching post everyday. I see so much life in him that it doesn't quite feel right to just put him down in a few days. 

  
However, since he has just been diagnosed with CHF our vet has told us to keep him in a room with no bed and let him just stay there to minimize his activities as to not strain his heart? He has a lot of fluid in his chest that is making it heavy to breath, just started Salix so hopefully that helps. We don't want to put him down just yet, but staying in one room sounds like a terrible way for him to enjoy the rest of his life...

884,1667962600,self.CatAdvice,True,"Video in link. Separated at end as black one seemed a bit vicious and orange one looked like he was trying to escape and failing.

Orange cat is 1.5 years, black one is 7 months. Don’t live in same household. Introduced correctly when black kitten was about 15 weeks. They see each other around twice a week maximum. Always in orange cats house. They always fight, rarely sit peacfullly with each other. During fights, occasional hissing and meowing. Orange one sometimes runs away and black one pursues constantly. We have put a lead on black one at times so he can’t chase orange one, sometimes orange one initiates fights but also spends a lot more time at a distance when black one is restricted. When door shut between them orange one will paw at door and meow for the other one. 

Unsure if this is normal or if they shouldn’t be allowed together? Worried that maybe black one is terrorising orange one?

As soon as I'd call him he'd come out of his hiding place (under the bed is his favourite) and come out for lots of pats, head boops and cuddles. 

He was found on the street, and moved between shelters a lot. I live in a busy inner city apartment and he seems to be very nervous of the sounds of the city. Dogs barking and cars especially. I've been playing Music for Cats by David Teiei which seems to help. 

My issue is, two nights ago He got brave and went exploring the rest of the house at night. He accidentally knocked a plate down and made a huge crash. 
He seemed ok after, hid under the bed for a bit but came back into bed after a bit. 
Then this morning I was walking around my room, and walked behind him as he was eating, and it absolutely panicked him. Now he won't come near me for longer than a second for a quick pat. He even hissed at me when I tried to give him some tuna as a treat. He won't leave my bedroom at all and runs under the bed if I come near him. 

I've left him in my room with all the windows in the house closed for sound, Music for Cats on repeat in the lounge and the bedroom door slightly ajar. 
I have to be at work for 8 hours now and i am just so worried about him. He's been fine left before, and I have been slowly working up to a full 8 hour day apart, but after his scares I'm worried.

894,1667950653,self.CatAdvice,True,"We adopted a 4-year old stray back in August and she was incredible quiet and shy the first few weeks of us having her around. We are first time cat owners, so there's a lot we are learning! Our little furiend has been opening up slowly, but that also means she has come to show us maybe her more natural play style which is more aggressive. 

The other day, my SO was eating dinner and she just came up to him and bit his arm (drew blood!) unprovoked. This morning, after playing with her, I was sitting down and she grabbed and scratched + bit my ankle. The past few incidents have occurred in the kitchen; these incidents are growing in frequency.

Doing some internet research tells me she is maybe trying to initiate play? But the biting and drawing blood is clearly a behavioral issue (these are definitely not nips; they're full on chomps). We are not sure what to do. When we give her Gabapentin (we need to for us to be able to trim her nails or go to the vet), she is obviously more chill. I know the original shelter gave her Gabapentin for anxiety for the first few months of her intake because she was so anxious. We are considering giving her meds on the regular, but was curious to know if there's anything we can do to change her behavior without drugs.

900,1667939815,self.CatAdvice,True,"Question about my 3.5 year old male cat

my spouse and I adopted a male cat in the beginning of 2020. He is the sweetest thing and we absolutely adore him. However, he does have a very odd habit and we are constantly wondering if this is normal. As we get ready to go to bed (our place is very small, only 500 ft.² so we are never going far from his usual resting place) no matter the time of day or night he will *run* in the room and begin howling very loudly. He will do this regardless if I’m taking a nap at 2 o’clock in the afternoon or if I’m getting to bed late at one in the morning…But anytime we start to settle down he will absolutely lose his mind. There is no stopping him either, we try to get him to settle, pet him, welcome him onto the bed, let him dig under the covers- he is relentless. It makes me sad because often we have to shut him out of the room because we can’t get him to stop and settle down. 
Luckily he doesn’t really mind being out of the room in the living room as his tree and toys are out there and he’ll sleep usually until about 5 AM which then I will be woken up by his relentless howling again. 

At this time I try to let him in the room and get him on the bed and calm him down. And sporadically he will get up and howl again. He is a very verbal cat, sometimes to a point I can’t even believe. During normal hours of the day he is always talking which is much appreciated as he makes a great companion.. but we seriously cannot figure out why he is doing this when we start to wind down or how to make it stop. We need sleep!! 

A couple other things of note- he gets fed wet food every evening around 6/7 o’clock. We constantly have dry food out for him and he has multiple water locations in the house and two litter boxes. We have another male cat (6 years old) who is a great friend to our 3.5 year old cat- they get along great, cuddle, bathe each other, play.. never had any issues between the two of them after their initial meeting beginning of 2020.

The vet gave us a cone for his head but did not put it on for us, we tried to put it on but he practically backflips getting it off. It does not stay on for more than a minute. Is this needed? As the vet didn't put it on maybe it's just incase.. We also got no pain medication.

903,1667931933,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat is an unspayed (spaying her later this month) female 1.7 year old cat who I adopted two months ago. I don’t wanna hear the “play with her more” advice because I do that enough, I even trained her how to sit. I try to play with her before I leave for class, and in the night I play with her for 30 minutes before I feed her. Sometimes I think she’s stopped being as crazy as when she first warmed up to me, but then there’s still many times in the day where she runs around and has zoomies. Idk how long they’re supposed to last, but sometimes they last more than 30 minutes or continuously as short (5 minute) reoccurring bursts back to back for a good while. The only moments she’s not doing this is when she’s at the window or taking a nap. Every other time, she’s running around everywhere and wants to touch EVERYTHING, even when I’m folding clothes or making the bed. 

She’s able to sleep at same time as me, but she wakes me up 2 hours before my alarm and tries to scratch underneath me  and just bothers me so much. I think she tries to get comfortable on me but she just continuously walks over me, bites my legs, gets under the covers to keep messing with me, and scratches the blankets. I still think that she’s worse in the day, where she does unnecessary stuff like scratch the tv that’s not even on and randomly attacks me. 

Is her age an appropriate age for all this?

911,1667924465,self.CatAdvice,True,"Me and my girlfriend took in a kitten named Friday and she's a 5 month old tuxedo cat. She's currently at the teenager years and is running around our small apartment in bursts of energy. We play with her fairly consistently and try to make sure we follow the Cat Mojo method (Hunt, Catch, Kill, Eat, Groom, Sleep) and play with her before we feed her for about 30-45 minutes twice a day, once at 8:30am and once at 8:30pm. Like I said, we live in a pretty small, open-concept apartment and our bedroom is essentially just the attic of a 3 story building. Because of that, we don't have a proper door but rather a set of stairs. And that was all fine until we brought in a kitten. Like I said she's pretty energetic and loves to run around the apartment and get into everything, and this is doubled in the morning around 5am. Lately she's been a complete nuisance, getting into things she knows she's not supposed to, biting wires, scratching up the box spring, pretty much anything she can play with to wake us up. We think it has something to do with daylight savings time, as she'd usually do this around 6 when my girlfriend wakes up for work, but regardless it's pretty irritating and while I understand this is ""just a cat thing"", we'd like to work out some solutions here.

We were considering getting a baby gate and locking her out when she gets like this but as you can see, [the stairway](https://imgur.com/a/qtgAuB3) is pretty wide and there's tons of little nooks and crannies she can get around in. We have 2 other rooms with doors in them in the apartment, the office and bathroom but honestly I don't want to lock her in these rooms when she's misbehaving. That'll only get her to be afraid of me and I don't really want to sacrifice her trust for a few hours of sleep. so that's not really an option I'm willing to take.

Honestly I feel a bit guilty for asking how to keep our cat out of our bedroom as I want the best for her and I know having her sleep next to us will strengthen the bond but at the end of the day, we can't be waking up at 5am every day and be functional.

915,1667917986,self.CatAdvice,True,"My 4-to-5-month-old kitten has a really bad habit that, from what the vet can tell, is not health-related. It appears that when he wants something (play) and I don't give it to him for too long, he goes to his bed and pees in it.

Usually I always give him the attention he wants and it doesn't come to this, but sometimes he wants to play in the morning when I'm not even out of bed yet so I tend to have the '10 more minutes' mindset. This almost always happened in the morning.

916,1667915875,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hoping to get some insight. I have a 3.5 month kitten and have had her for about 1 month. She was a stray before I got her, so no idea if she was alone or what kind of life she had. 

I recently got a 2 month old kitten and at first the older one was growling a lot. She was also shaking and acting more scared than aggressive. We did some slow interactions. 

Over the past couple days, I’ve had them both together and exploring, and the best way I can describe the older kitten’s attitude is fixated and obsessed. 

She will ignore everything and watch the younger kitten. She constantly runs up and smacks her quite hard, but without claws as far as I can tell the growling is getting less, but she will not leave the younger kitten alone. At all. Constantly chasing her, running up to her, smacking her. Even if I lift the kitten up onto the couch and block her with my leg, the older one will run around the couch to find a way to see the younger one. Nonstop. Relentless. Fixated.

I'm a full time college living with roommates, so there's no empty room I can keep them in. I feel totally defeated.

922,1667911166,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat is 5 months old, I found him as a stray when he was about 8 weeks old and there have been a lot of ups and downs with him.  Yes he’s been to the vet .

In the past couple of weeks he has been jumping up on my bed and clawing at the covers which scratches the heck out of me, and if I leave my arms out from under the blankets he will straddle them and start biting and rabbit kicking.  Most of the time he is purring while he does so, and it’s not as hard as I know he can bite but it still really hurts and always wakes me up.

Now this behavior has worsened.  Every night, multiple times through the night he wakes me up by biting at my face/head or hair, and he’s even straddled my head and rabbit kicked and clawed the shit out of my head.

I’ll usually get him off of my head and put him on the ground, but he will just hop back on the bed, walk back over to me and resume whatever he is doing.  This isn’t soft bites or kicks, it’s very painful and I end up just covering myself entirely under the sheets, which he will claw at and scratch me through, and then I inevitably just get up and go sleep outside my room.

The worst part is that if I get up, he’s fine.  If I lie on the floor, he’s fine, but if I go to my bed, even if I sit up on the bed he will meow at me, claw at me and bite me until I get up.  He doesn’t want fed because I tried that and he didn’t seem to eager to eat all his food, but I haven’t tried playing with him because usually I’m so pissed off that I’m not about to reward him with playtime.

I always play with him for like 30 minutes before I go to bed and I usually watch him go curl up in his cat tree while I get ready for bed myself.

I can’t let him outside my room unless I am with him because I have two roommates and if they get up before me and leave the house I’m worried he may escape out the front door, or that he will break their items while I’m sleeping and then I’ll have to pay for them.

929,1667881600,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi. I’m currently living on Oahu and recently discovered a mother car and her for kittens living under my storage shed in my backyard. The kittens are still being nursed by their mother but they appear to be about 6 to 8 weeks old.

My wife and I were recently talking about adopting a couple of cats and are wondering if it is wise to try to rescue the kittens. The mother and the kittens are definitely feral. I’ve read that kittens can be socialized up to four months or so.

Would it be a good idea to try to adopt and socialize two of the kittens? Does anyone familiar with Hawaii know what we could do with the other kittens? The local Humane Society does not accept feral cats at this time and I’m not sure where else to go.

Or would it be a better idea to leave the kittens with their mother and just adopt cats from the local Humane Society?

930,1667881068,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat (3F, 10lbs) and my roommate’s dog (6F, 30lbs) moved in together 2 weeks ago. The cat had not lived in this apartment full time before, but she was familiar with the space, long story. Everything went well at first. The dog is super chill and wasn’t reacting at all to my cat. Usually she’s lying on the floor somewhere. We gave the cat plenty of space and a protective pet gate she could hide behind until she seemed comfortable. She never really hissed at the dog or showed aggression, she just ran away when she got scared. Through all this, the dog never so much as barked or growled. Suddenly in the past couple days my cat has started approaching the dog and hissing, swatting, and generally being a dick. The dog is very skittish and wants to get away, but sometimes the cat will trap her in a room by standing in the doorway, etc. The dog seems super panicked and I keep breaking it up, but I don’t know what else I can do. They were working on some kind of equilibrium and now my Asshole cat is the villain. Any tips to help her relax and leave the dog alone?

934,1667878594,self.CatAdvice,True,"Ugh where do I even begin… My husband and I have a 6 year old female cat. She’s super sweet and precious. However over the last year, she has begun to urinate relentlessly all over the house and it’s driving me insane.

This all began when I first got pregnant. She started peeing on our laundry randomly. I thought she had an UTI so I took her to the vet. The vet told us everything looked fine but gave us an antibiotic just incase. We saw no real improvement in the inappropriate urinating. She then started to pee on the carpets randomly. We thought maybe she didn’t like the box and/or liter she was using, so we changed those out - Didn’t help. I had husband start cleaning her boxes out twice a day - didn’t help. I thought maybe she needed more love and attention - didn’t help. We’ve been just fighting random inappropriate urination by cleaning with enzyme cleaner assuming it was a behavioral issue due to her sensing my new pregnancy hormones, hoping it would eventually pass. The vet said she must be stressed about something causing the behavior since it would come and go. No medical issues have been identified. 

Well since baby has been born 5 months ago, she’s gotten relentless about it. She’s refusing to use her liter box all together. Our son is extremely colicky ( he has a lot of food allergies that we’ve been discovering/removing from his diet) and spends a great deal of time screaming. Hubs &amp; I are pretty certain that kitty isn’t adjusting to baby and is incredibly anxious from his screaming. She’s ruined our upstairs carpet, some hardwood floors, countless pairs of shoes/bags/clothes. I have to clean the bathtubs out daily because she now is pooping in there. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind locations or textures of where she is going. She hasn’t soiled anything of the baby’s yet but if she does, that will likely push it overboard. We’ve tried anxiety meds, allowing her to go outside, checking for other medical issues. The vet told us as she acclimates it should stop, but it isn’t getting any better - it keeps getting worse. I’m at a 100% loss on how to make this transition easier for her. 

This new Mom is growing exhausted of constantly cleaning up cat pee and poop.  Husband is down to two pairs of shoes after her ruining all of his other ones. Babe is starting to show signs of wanting to crawl - which terrifies me that he’ll accidentally find one of her random spots. 

How do I help her transition &amp; calm down so she can use her liter box again? I feel like I’m running out if options... If we can’t solve this issue, I’m scared we may need to consider rehoming her. However I’m sure it’s damn near impossible to rehome a cat with urination problems… I can’t imagine taking her to a shelter and something terrible happening to her. I’ve never been one to ever consider rehoming a pet, but this is getting out of control and could be a real health hazard for our son. Any advise on how to fix this issue?

935,1667878118,self.CatAdvice,True,"* please no judgement *

Today I made the decision that since i’m moving to another continent that my amazing and sweet cat will not be coming with me as it would be intensely stressful to be fostered for months and then reuniting with me (airplane and train rides, etc). It was about ~$2700 to cargo her to the UK with me, which was not in budget. My other option was to get someone to foster her till August when I can return to bring her with me and have the space ready. I thought about it and spoke to several people and they have all told me that it would be awfully stressful for her mentally. 

It’s the most difficult decision I’ve ever made in my life and I am absolutely devastated and beyond heartbroken because she’s saved my life the 3 years I’ve had her (not an exaggeration), but it’s best for her to not have all of the stress of 8 months without me and then travelling 12-15 hours to a new place, plus being fostered she will get used to her foster parents and then be sad when she leaves them. It’s not fair to her. So I am deciding to rehome her to a family or person that can always be there for her and be constantly there. I have a month and a half left with her before I am deciding to drop her off to her forever home. I will probably never see her again. 

Does it ever get better? I feel selfish for wanting to put her through that long gruelling journey. Will I ever come to forgive myself for this? Will she forgive me?

936,1667877634,self.CatAdvice,True,"Some context: a feral cat showed up and had three kittens somewhere near our house last winter - ginger male, tortie female, &amp; calico female. She bailed eventually, but the kittens have stuck around and we feed them, they’re now about 13-14 months old. The ginger and tortie have been steadily growing, but the calico just stopped one day. She still pretty much looks like a kitten. 

Is it possible she has dwarfism, or could she just be a very small cat? Does she appear abnormally small? She was the runt of her litter and always the most skittish. Not food motivated at all, and I’ve never been able to touch her. She is so skittish that she evaded us BOTH rounds we tried to TNR which stresses me out, but at 13 months she hasn’t been in heat yet either. Not sure if that’s a consequence of her size or something else, but other than these two things she appears healthy. If anyone could weigh in I’d appreciate it - I want to trap her to be spayed , but if there’s any chance she has a disorder I’ll get her to the vet for blood work before going strait to a TNR clinic.

937,1667876044,self.CatAdvice,True,So I have a pretty mellow bonded pair of 1.25yo cats that we've had for about a year now. We got them slightly after the socialization window and as a result they really weren't ever properly socialized. Over the year they did eventually warm up to us a bit. We recently added a 2.5mo kitten to the mix. We kept him separated and did our best to follow introduction tutorials and eventually made it to a point where all of them were playing under the door. Hissing and growling was at a minimum if at all so we figured it's a good time to start having some supervised time together. Lots of hissing and growling from the resident cats initially but now all one of them wants to do is play with the kitten. They just chase each other around. The problem is that the other one is still hissing and growling until they're swatting at each other. The kitten for whatever reason keeps trying to play with him and corners him and it gets a bit worrisome so I break it up.

939,1667875208,self.CatAdvice,True,"i’m seeing the vet tomorrow. but i feel like i’m at my wits end and need to talk about this. 

my cat has peed on my bed and couch several times, and now a nice lounge chair. at first i thought it was because she could smell her old pee in my mattress. but now that she’s peed on the chair for the first time i know it’s not about that. 

many times i’ve caught her digging on either of these places so i picked her up and put her in her litter box and she peed. 

she also pooped once on my bed recently. 

her litter boxes are very clean i make sure of that. they are very accessible and for the most part she uses them throughout the day. 

vet ruled out uti. did a blood test. and if it were uncontrollable accidents (like if she couldn’t help it) she wouldn’t go out of her way to climb up, start digging, and go on our furniture when her litter boxes are right there.

They’re very calm around me now and they’ve made their new home in my room. The only thing they avoid there are the cat beds I got them, but that’s no surprise.

My first rescue didn’t like getting meds but was relatively compliant. This new cat will not take the meds - I have tried every method. He won’t eat wet food. I went to my vet today to have them show me any tricks and tips and wrapped him exactly as they did in a towel, however, he is literally snapping like a shark and I cannot get near his mouth. I had someone else holding his head/body still while wrapped in the towel but he still came close to biting me. I’m not sure what else to do. The vet says that they don’t offer the meds he’s on in any other form. I offered to bring him as often as needed for shots if possible or any other form they could provide. The meds are just for a cold (antibiotic and anti cold meds is what they told me) so I’m really wondering if there is any other alternative? Really grateful for any advice anyone has.

942,1667871475,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a 4 month old kitten a week ago and I love him! I have a senior, blind pug (Bubba-15yo) at home and they are getting along great. The only issue was that Bubba was a little scared and nervous because he has never been around cats before. But he is slowly warming up, and the kitten is letting him take his time! I just know that they will be taking naps together in no time!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Today though I noticed something a little worrisome. My kitten was eating the dogs food! I have been giving the kitten wet food alongside his dry food and his bowl is never empty. So he isn't starving or anything. I know that my dog would eat the kittens food if he could get to it too (The kittens food is on the patio where the dog can't go). That's not really relevant. I worry about malnutrition if the kitten keeps doing this. My dog is too old, and blind, to try to schedule when he eats (he has been free eating since he was a couple months old).

I can try to train him with the spray bottle and positive reinforcement, but I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions? Please let me know! Also, here are some adorable pics of my babies :)

945,1667857984,self.CatAdvice,True,"I’m not really looking for advice but would be nice to hear anyone else’s experience with a super sickly kitten. We rescued our two kittens back in March and we were so in love - they were about four months. Our younger baby, Tig, was very skinny and small but they couldn’t find anything wrong with her at the time. We rescued her knowing she would likely have health problems but we didn’t know the extent of it. All I can say is GET PET INSURANCE!!! It allowed us to treat her to the best extent possible and they paid out £12,000 in six months. We are in the U.K. so might be better here not sure. 

About a month in, she started acting a bit strange and sleeping a lot. We took her to the vet who suspected she had FIP but gave us some other things to try. Fast forward, she almost died in the vet hospital with her stomach full of fluid but we were so lucky to save her with a newer approved drug in the U.K. it involved us giving her a shot daily in her back/neck for two weeks which was extremely traumatic honestly. We finally switched to a pill form and three months later, she seemed to be fully recovered. But as soon as she came off the pills, we noticed she started having diahrrea. 

We did every test, multiple stool samples, two ultrasounds, a colon biopsy to finally settle on her having developed IBS. This took about 4 months and the diahrrea just got worse and worse to the point where she can’t control when she goes. There was also a lot of blood in her stool. She’s now not always able to make it to the litter tray and we are cleaning up poop all over our flat and washing sheets/towels anything we can use to keep it off our furniture. The thing is she’s still eating and has some good days. We were finally able to start her on steroids a week and a half ago but it hasn’t made a difference yet. 

We love her so much and couldn’t imagine giving her away or putting her down. But I’m terrified she won’t get better and we’ve given our lives to her the last six months. I thought we saved her only to now watch her deal with this IBS. It’s so heartbreaking but I’m also trying to be strong. I just want her to get better so badly.

946,1667854352,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi all! I recently adopted a cat almost a month ago who was considered unadoptable due to his spicy personality. Since bringing him home, he has come out of his shell more and will freely walk around and explore usually after 9pm. He eats, drinks, uses his litter box and has night zoomies. I haven’t attempted to pet him since he seems to be scared of hands coming towards him.

The adoption place didn’t have much background on him before he came to them, but I believe due to his behavior he may have been abused and/or abandoned. At night time, I’ll lay on my couch while he hides under it and I will watch him play with his spring toys. He is incredibly happy and loves to play with them while I “watch” him using my phone’s camera (so I’m not directly watching him). I believe me being in front of him scares him.

During the day, I try to play with him so he doesn’t have any play aggression, however if I sit on the ground or grab his favorite toy, he will hiss at me and growl (while slowly approaching me from under the couch) until I back away. I’m not sure what is causing him to do this. At night he is completely loving and has no fear of me. I’m not sure if it just requires more patience until I build more trust with him or what.

He has a cat tree with hiding spots, I have pheromone spray, lots of toys, and have blocked off under my bed/top of cabinets. Any advice would be great.

951,1667838105,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello, I adopted a sweet little single male kitten at 4 months old, he is very independent yet shy. He's been such a good boy and has given me no trouble.   


I work night shift (11pm-7am) during the week, with weekends off. On my weekends, sometimes I like to stay up all day and have a somewhat normal (but often sporadic) sleeping schedule. During the weekend I'll either reverse my sleeping schedule or sleep at random times, giving me time to have a life and do some errands.   


My question is, how much does this affect my cat? He doesn't seem to mind, and he will let me know when he's hungry and when he wants to play. I have no set feeding schedule on the weekends, I leave kibble for him and he snacks on it, but he always waits for wet food for his full meals.

967,1667795337,self.CatAdvice,True,"My cat (2) is having issues pooping and peeing outside of the litter box. Almost every day he will poop or pee outside of the litter box and it’s causing distress for my family. These aren’t little messes either, and they take a long time to clean up. This really stresses out my mom and she’s the person that usually has to clean them up. Now for some background information, we got our cat in 2020 when he was a few months old, and then we fostered him. Previous to that he had been living with a vet tech with no other kittens. If you have any knowledge of fostering cats, you know that kittens need to be socialized with other kittens so they learn how to get along with other cats and it helps them emotionally develop properly. Well our cat should’ve been given to us earlier but hadn’t, but anyway we took him in with our other kittens. We already had two other cats at this point. Around New Years 2020 we adopted our cat. Then he started pooping around the house, but less often than he is now. Then we moved houses and this is when the issue started to get worse. He started mostly pooping large amounts around the house. We believe it’s mostly a behavioral issue. It’s also important to add that our cat is very small. Like at two years old he’s about half the size of a fully grown cat when he’s already full grown. He messes with one of the other cats (let’s call him tuxedo cat). Tuxedo cat and the third cat (let’s call him lion cat) our best friends and we think that when lion cats sees tuxedo cat getting bullied he then bullies the cat with issues. Lion cat bullying problem cat could be unrelated to tuxedo cat getting messed with. Anyway the problem has gotten to the point where this is our last straw. It’s too mentally difficult to deal with it every day. We’ve tried almost every solution and they haven’t worked, meanwhile the vet bills have been racking up. We recently took him to the vet again and they think it is a behavioral issue so they’re prescribing him chicken broth prozac and for him to be house trained again for two weeks. We’re doing that in my sisters room and we put a litter box in her bathroom. We think he has separation anxiety from my sister because they are really close and he’s always with her. When she’s not home (which is often because our parents are separated) he will cry outside of her door for hours. The vet also said that the issue may only go away if we if we give him back again to the shelter (no kill) and if he gets adopted again the issue may go away in the new house.

970,1667792884,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hi! This is my first post and I was hoping that anyone with experience or knowledge could help me.
I'll try to be brief. 4 years ago I've adopted my first cat which was already 4 years old. She has been living with me since then and we live in a small apartment (bathroom, kitchen, living room).
Yesterday, previously taking all the medical precautions with both animals, I brought to my apartment my girlfriend's cat. He will be living with us some time due to some personal issues where the cat was previously living.

The newcomer's attitude is to hide in small and dark places. He licks a bit, gets out for food/water, today he was able to use the litter-box. He walks cautiously through the apartment.
On the other hand, my cat, is being territorial. He growls at him, maintains distance and watches him silently. Usually is a very sweet cat, like a really lot, but now she is being grumpy.

I was expecting some sort of similar scenario and I think, based on similar experiences with dogs or relatives cats, that this is a common situation. 
What's I'm looking for is, based on your knowledge and experience, if there is anything that you could recommend me for making this experience ""nicer"" for them. I'm not expecting a quick solution or speed up the process, just any tips or tricks you could teach me!

971,1667792116,self.CatAdvice,True,"There’s a barn cat that lives in the barn behind my property. My neighbor down the road had a cat colony and I guess this cat came from that colony. At first I didn’t mind her presence, she actually keeps the property mouse free. But then she started having kittens. 

Only one stuck around with her and I wasn’t super concerned since they weren’t coming around my house for food. I also thought since they were connected to my neighbors colony that it wasn’t really my business… until they both had kittens under my house last spring. 

I love cats, I have two of my own. But they are indoor cats. But I do not want a colony on my hands both for their safety and just generally not wanting to be held responsible for that many cats. 

I tried via two different humane societies in my area to get the two females signed up for TNR once the kittens were of weaning age but they both had wait lists that were MONTHS out. And both became pregnant again before their turn for the program came which was well into both pregnancies. Thankfully it’s just two males between them. But I tried to get at least the two moms fixed out of pocket to be done with it… but getting a SINGLE cat spayed out of pocket is 500 dollars, what the hell??? 

I feel so trapped. I tried to do the responsible thing the first time around but couldn’t get them fixed in time. Tried a more direct approach only to be smacked with a 1k price tag for cats that I don’t even consider mine ? I can’t bring this to the neighbor either as there is a language barrier. 

I’m gonna try to get them both listed for TNR again and hope they don’t get pregnant before then again, but if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it.

972,1667791852,self.CatAdvice,True,"I adopted a kitten who is 3 months old and weighs a little over 2 lbs. I want to give her a combination of wet and dry food, but I'm not sure how much of each to have a proper balance.

974,1667790141,self.CatAdvice,True,"Adopted a nine year old cat back in August.  No history or background from the shelter.  

She was obviously a pet and well cared for by someone though.  Loves people (adults and kids), well behaved, etc.  


I have a smaller house, so I bought her a covered litter box.  

Originally I used So Phresh clay litter, but it was way too dusty for a covered box.  It made me squint and cough when I added new litter, and set off my air purifier from 20 feet away.  

So I switched to Dr. Elsey Ultra....dust free and low tracking.  


The thing is, my cat doesn't seem to like it.  She didn't like the So Phresh either.  


I've got a larger covered box than she needs at her size.  And I clean it TWO TO THREE times per day.  

Every time she goes to use it though she puts her tail down and walks into it slowly, then she digs to China for 30+ seconds, kicking a ton out of the covered box/door, then leaves the box with her tail down and refuses to acknowledge me.  She will go and lay down in one of her spots for 10-15 minutes.  

I swear she kicks out a tenth of her litter box content every time she uses the bathroom.  

I have a litter collecting mat outside the box, but it doesn't help.  

I have to use my dust buster to clean her litter mat 2-3 times per day, and I have to vacuum around the litter mat 2-3 times per day as well.

977,1667788128,self.CatAdvice,True,"I'm 21 years old, a college student and I have a job. My friend found a cat in the woods and brought it home over the summer, she ended up having kittens and he asked me to take one. I said I'd think about it. When I told my roommates, they were ecstatic and wanted me to get one so badly. I think I decided to go ahead with it because of them rather than what I truly felt deep inside. 

She's a little over three months old and I've had her for two weeks now. The first week was hell since she's a total ball of energy and I couldn't figure out how to help her get it all out. Now that we have somewhat of a routine, she's sweet and friendly and seems to be happy here. I've done lots and LOTS of research, and I'd like to think that I'm taking really good care of her. She's already bonded with me quite a bit: sleeps next to me almost every night, follows me around the apartment and jumps up on my shoulder all the time. 

I truly care about her so much and I just want her to have the best life possible. However, this responsibility has been weighing on me. I'm out for hours at a time for school and work, sometimes the entire day. I have someone that I'm seeing and I want to go out on dates with them. When I'm home, I have chores, homework and I want to watch TV sometimes. But every second that I'm not paying attention to her makes me feel so guilty. I play with her for at least twenty minutes every day, but sometimes multiple hours. I got her a cat tree and several toys she can play with on her own, and my roommates are usually around to hang out with her as well, but I still feel bad whenever I go out. 

Logically, I know I'm doing everything to the best of my ability. But it's gotten to a point where every time I look at her, I'm filled with regret and the weight of the responsibility I have now, rather than joy and love for her.

We both work jobs where mid-day meals is not an option, so instead we have been doing a decent size bowl of dry kitten food (they self regulate well and a 1/4-1/2 cup lasts about the entire day). We were doing one, half 3oz can a day for each at first in combo with the dry food, but I want to up this to 1/2 can twice a day now. 

They haven’t been complaining or overly begging for food at all, I just want to make sure this seems fine and not too much/too little.

Her sister was supposed to go to another family, but they fell through. My parents are looking for a cat so I said we'd take the sister for them.

Last night my partner picked up the sister, thinking he could take her home, and that the two would get along and know who each other were. It did not go that way....

The sister was traumatized, having been taken from her mum and then driven a long way already that day(in the middle of this there was also a fire drill at our apartment, and my partner was outside with both kitties). 

Partner called me, super stressed out, I said to just take the sister to my parents place and we can introduce them later.

We're hoping that when we go away we can take our kitty to my parents place and when my parents go away, we can take the sister.

Long story short, I got a kitten in may, who was one month old, and have been raising him since. We lived in a bigger house during the beginning of his life, with three other cats, and a part time dog. We moved two months ago into a very small apartment, with no other pets. 

Ever since we moved, he has been meowing basically every moment he can. He has food, water, a clean littler box, plenty of toys and cat nip, and I’ve even been leash training him for two weeks to go on walks to get rid of some extra energy. Which to be honest, has backfired to a degree, because he now yells if I don’t do it on time, or don’t have us stay out long enough, or he wants to go back out later (which he always does). He meows basically any time he isn’t sleeping, eating, walking on the leash or playing, and I just. Am completely overwhelmed. I’m trying so hard to be a good pet mom, and do what I can for him, but I literally don’t know what else to do.

991,1667773984,self.CatAdvice,True,"So, we have two female cats, a tortoiseshell (7yo) and a void (2yo). The older one has a history of UTIs, so we’re used to seeing her pee when she’s sick, but it’s always a small amount. We give her supplements and feed her mostly wet food to mitigate the situation.

Here’s the problem: we have a basement that leads to a sunroom in the backyard. Over the summer, Tortie started peeing there. Almost every day. She pees right at the door, even though there’s a litter box 5 feet away. We’ve seen her use the litter box and STILL pee by the door. My wife has mopped the floor, sprayed enzymes and all kinds of keep-away products and nothing works. Wife lays down foil, Tortie pees. Wife uses Feliway, Tortie pees. Wife blocks the door. Tortie pees as close to the blockade as possible. Oddly, Void never pees there. No clue why.

The one theory I have is mice. We’ve seen two or three mice in the basement over the last two years,  but they don’t last long. Both cats are hunters. The few mice we’ve seen are in their mouths, displayed proudly. But when I cleaned out the sunroom, I noticed mice droppings. Admittedly, these cats are the first pets I’ve ever had, so maybe my theory is dumb, but I’m wondering if she’s peeing there to keep mice away. If so, it’s admirable, but annoying!

So, does my theory hold water? And if not, what else can I try? We’ve basically lost the use of an entire room of our house because it always smells like cat piss. Any and all suggestions are welcome, I am completely out of my depth and I’m begging! Help!

992,1667772470,self.CatAdvice,True,"My senior cat is starting to have constipation issues. The started when the vet prescribed a joint supplement. My senior cat has already done this once, going to the vet. Got the enema, pissed as hell, came home and within a few hours started perking up.

A month later I start giving it to her prior to figuring out it was causing her dehydration. So she is constipated again. She has had a full day of pumpkin and a mild lax. And we finally saw her pass one hard round small turd. So I know the pumpkin is starting to absorb. 

But I am wondering if I could give her a small enema at home to help relieve pressure from the back end. She has started to puke a little for being all stuffed up. But seeing the one turd gives me hope.

993,1667771984,self.CatAdvice,True,"I have a 13 year old kitty, let's call her B (name has been withheld to protect what remains of her dignity). And recently, B has been peeing on everything.

Backstory: my husband and I adopted B from a shelter when she was 4. She had previously been in a traffic accident, and is missing her tail and her back right leg as a result. (I suspect she was the one driving the car). B is an indoor cat and always has been - we are in the UK, so this is actually quite unusual, since the majority of cats here are allowed outside. Anyway. Other than the missing limbs, and a couple of mild bouts of cystitis, B has been in great health since we adopted her. Her mobility is limited in that she can't jump up high, just scrambles onto a chair/bed, but she can run fairly fast. Personality-wise, she's a very vocal cat, pretty social and likes to curl up on my lap, but a bit 'emotionally needy'. We have had issues on and off with excessive crying at night, but that has improved in recent years.

B has occasionally done a 'stress pee' outside her litterbox, if upset by something like an unexpected houseguest. Two years ago, we had a baby, and the stress-peeing got a little bit more frequent. Ok, that's not unusual, cats need time to adapt to a baby. We didn't force any interaction, made sure B had her own baby-free retreat space, kept a Feliway running etc. Now baby is a toddler, and to be fair, they are both good companions. B hasn't displayed any aggression and will happily curl up next to toddler; toddler understands 'gentle hands' and generally respects the cat's space. One big difference is that B is now shut out of baby's room at night (she has free range over the rest of our flat).

In the last few months, B has been peeing outside her box a couple of times a week, and suddenly in the last week she is doing it every day. She has two litterboxes, always accessible, one in each bathroom, and we use the same wooden biodegradable litter that we have always used. The boxes are scooped immediately after a poop, and the litter changed weekly. But she's peeing randomly on rugs, chairs, and anything left on the floor for a moment, such as a towel. She even pees near her food bowl now.

When the issue started a few months ago, I took her to our vet. He gave her a physical checkup, found nothing wrong, and said that the issue was behavioural. Liquid fluoxetine (kitty prozac) was prescribed, which we mixed in with her wet food or a cat-yoghurt treat once a day. This worked well for about a month, but then B figured out that the food/treat had medicine mixed in, and refused to touch it. So then we were back at the original problem. I can't get her to take the food via syringe or spoon, because it causes her a huge amount of distress which defeats the whole point of prozac.

I suspect/fear that she is bored, because she will often paw at furniture or the window blinds to make a noise and get our attention. She gets lots of social attention, i.e. petting and lap time, but it's really hard to play with her because she ignores most toys, ribbons, string, balls and so on. I've bought enrichment toys for her, I try hiding ribbons under things for her to find, and she either bats at them for two minutes then loses interest, or just acts like they're not there. I suspect the missing limbs/mobility issues make it harder for her to play.

I have a call scheduled with the vet tomorrow, and obviously will be getting her checked again. She is eating and drinking normally.

999,1667767348,self.CatAdvice,True,"Hello! I have a 4.5 month old kitten who’s just began teething. For the past two days he has been reluctant to finish his meals. This boy can EAT, so it is weird for him to leave at least 20% of his meal in his bowl. He’s getting like 50-100 fewer calories a day. 
He gets both wet and dry food each meal. Three days ago he struggled to chew his dry food so I soaked it and turned it into mash but he won’t eat that. He will eat most of the wet food but still leaves a good amount in his bowl. I can’t give him more wet food because that would require him to eat so much more food to get his caloric requirements and he refuses to finish that. I’ve tried. 
I’ve also tried heating food up, cooling food down, teething toys, kitty food popsicles, different bowls, lick mats, flavors etc.
