1669615692,self.DogAdvice,True,"So my family got a new puppy for some background context that’ll make all you dog owners probably face palm (this was not my decision to get a new dog) We own 2 cats and 1 dog the 2 cats don’t fuck with the puppy who’s name is Luna they might hiss if she tries playing with them but never attack her just basically telling Luna to go away. Now the other dog we have is Ivy. I was really young when we got her and you can tell this dog was unfortunately not raised good she puts her ears back and thinks your gonna hit her when you pet her and overall is very skittish of other people except me and my family. We used to have another dog Quincy and quite often the two would get into fights and eventually after one fight Quincy was hurt bad so bad we sadly had to put him down. I don’t blame Ivy she could’ve been raised a lot better where she wouldn’t be aggressive and any sane dog owner would not get a new dog after knowing the dog they have now got the previous dog killed. Just 2 days into having Luna, Ivy thought she was gonna take her bone and attacked her luckily I was right there and broke it up but Luna has a tiny tiny little mark from where Ivy literally had her jaws around her head. I told my mom this and i’m trying to get it through to her that Luna is a American terrier pit bull mixed with a bull (or atleast I think i’m not a dog person really so I don’t know breeds) So having this young puppy grow up where a dog is attacking her will have her grow up and be aggressive back to other dogs and even Ivy. She’s gonna be a big dog and I really don’t wanna see two big ass dogs go at it because it will most likely end very very bad. So now I really don’t know what to do it’s unfair to get rid of Ivy and it’s a little risky to try and raise Luna in this type of environment. so far i’ve kinda been the one to step up and train Luna to be a good dog as-well as giving Ivy attention and trying to get the two to bond it’s stressful I will say especially cause i can’t be around the two 24/7 and my mom thinks it’s perfectly fine to leave the two dogs in the house alone without putting Luna in a room to keep away from Ivy. I think after I get paid ill buy a crate to put her in for the time being till she’s older because when no one’s home and if Ivy attacks no one can break up that fight and Luna will grow up to view Ivy as dangerous and eventually start fighting back and a pitbull going up against a husky is not something I want to happen man. So overall any advice is really needed, is there a way I can retrain Ivy to be more confident and not skittish? and even have her be less aggressive to the puppy. Thank you.",DogAdvice,Dog aggressive to new puppy,
1669614240,self.DogAdvice,True,"Pretty self-explanatory title. I have a 9 mo old GSD and a 2.5 yr old bengal cross cat. My pup is obsessed with my cat. Not in like a stalking prey-drive way, but like an idolizing way. He adores her. Steals slippers and brings them to her as a gift lol. 

Now, my cat is a covid-cat and prior to getting my dog was an only fur-child. She's very possessive of me to say the least. There have been these instances that show my cat truly *loves* my dog, but she certainly doesn't *like* him. He is everything she hates – loud, smelly, hyper, and too close to me. 

My cat has grown more tolerant and lets him come near her but sometimes he gets too carried away poking her with his nose or jumping up towards where she is so she will hiss or growl. He gets more excited and keeps going so she'll start smacking him but he just doesn't leave her alone. The other day she managed to scratch his eye. He's ok but he very much has not learned anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some important points to add here: 

\- They are never left alone. If I or my roommate have to leave, my dog is in his crate. I don't suspect anything would happen but I don't want to find out

\- My dog's body language has never been threatening. It's playful and light and seems like he genuinely just wants to play

\- My cat doesn't instigate anything, she just is defensive. She'll be fine once he learns her boundaries (growling, hissing, hitting)",DogAdvice,How to get my german shepherd puppy to respect my cat's boundaries?,

We’ve both caved twice each and while he’s on the couch he just snuggles for 20 minutes and then returns to his own bed.

I adopted my puppy from a shelter at 6 months old- she was already spayed when we adopted her. Since day 1 we noticed that she was having frequent pee accidents in the house. I suspected a UTI and it turned out to be the case (even though the vet was skeptical, I was adamant that it wasn’t just behavioral). The uti was still there after a week of antibiotics. The vet then suggested to do a month long course of antibiotics, which we are now coming to the end of. 

Now and a few times previously I have noticed that my pup sometimes leaks urine when she’s sleeping.

I am taking her back for a follow up with the vet this week, but she has had a radiograph in the last month to rule out stones. 

I’m wondering if anyone out there has had a similar experience with a pup that was spayed very young? Is it poor muscle tone?

Or has anyone experienced incontinence in dogs who receive calming treats with hemp seed powder?

This post is more about some specific advice to manage the situation as I attempt to resolve it.

Basically, the dog barks through the night, I get up, try to settle him back in his crate, which never works, so I end up letting him in the living room to sleep on the sofa. I (try to) sleep on the other sofa, so he's doubly rewarded by getting to sleep on the sofa AND have me there with him.

The alternative, that I've just thought about while I lie awake on the sofa after another night of barely any sleep, is to actually set up a camp bed in the kitchen to see if he will then sleep through the night, and allow the rest of the house (and neighbours) to actually get some sleep.

I'm just wondering what the least-worst option is right now to save the family's sanity - keep letting him in the living room to sleep when he wakes up during the night, or seeing if he'll sleep though with me on a camp bed in the kitchen with him? I'm not sure right now what the exit strategy for either of those options is!

He's on a bland diet because of associated GI distress so I'm really limited on what I can mix it with to get him to take it. I tried mixing it with the chicken and rice, he's refusing to eat it even though he's hungry.

My dog is a bit on the reactive/high strung side. He isn't aggressive but he will bite if I invade his space too much. He's also wary of us because he was manhandled (understandably) at the vet and he isn't feeling well. So even getting to his mouth with the syringe without him showing his teeth or snapping is a challenge.

He has an open wound where they drained the abscess so it can continue to drain so I really don't want to wrestle him and risk hurting him.

1669515254,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi friends, first time rescue mum over here. I’m learning all I can about my new dog—it’s information overload on the web/YouTube so your advice and perspectives are very appreciated.

We adopted our wonderful Raya (2F) from the shelter 3 weeks ago. I’ve observed she LOVES food, nothing she won’t do for a training treat and mealtime is her favorite time. Raya loves the kibble dispensing toys, Lick Mats, Snuffle Mats, stuffed Kongs, you name it. I work from home, so I’m happy to give her these things throughout the day to keep her occupied.

But Raya is frequently peeing in the house (1-2x daily for weeks) despite being healthy and taken outside frequently and given lavish praise/treats for toileting outside. Usually a few ounces of urine in the same spots each time, and I never catch her doing it. 

Seems like whenever I take my eyes off her to focus on something else (my dish, the stove, vacuuming), she’ll stealth-pee and act like nothing happened. I don’t discipline/yell at her or anything, of course.

What’s usually happening when she pees—we’re eating, there’s people food around (I cook a lot), she’s playing with her Wobble (kibble dispensing toy), she’s got some sort of food toy like a Snuffle mat, I’ve left the room and she’s alone or with husband (who she likes but she spends far less time with), I’m vacuuming (I crate her and go slowly/avoid her area to not scare her).

Raya gets 2-3 25+ min walks + quick potty breaks daily, I’d guess she’s outside every few hours (I even set timers). But she’s quite content snoozing on the couch all day.

I’m wondering if it’s possible I’ve rushed her transition to a new home and overloaded her, especially with too much high stimulus food toy time? 

My initial approach was to build up her confidence being alone, since she’d whine/pace/be destructive whenever I’d leave the floor. Also it seemed like she spent a lot of time snoozing or following me around. So, I started giving her a lot of food toy distractions and leave, hoping she’d associate good things with being alone.

What’s going on and what could I be doing wrong? How can I stop the inappropriate peeing?

Thanks in advance, everyone.",DogAdvice,Am I overstimulating my food-motivated dog to the point of urination in the house?,

I had downstairs neighbors who were always great and our friends, never seemed to complain about a single thing and even then we would acknowledge if we were a bit loud and apologize to them when we could. There were over 3 people living in that apartment and they had a dog the same as us so my dog was always able to play around with their dog and we all got along great. Eventually though they moved and in came new neighbors and no more than a few weeks later we began to hear them hitting their roof with most likely a broom and at first we didn’t know what it was for as we all tend to stay in our rooms or on the couch, but as time went on we noticed this was happening while my dog ran around with zoomies. Eventually we got a note on our door stating they were tired of the noise and have knocked on our door many times to speak to our face about the matter, but it never said anything about the disturbance of sleep or work mind you, and they said they would hear it more in the afternoon than any other time which no one is home from 11-4 so we had a chat with them face to face and explained the noise as well as introduced our pet to them to clear it up. So we apologized and went our way but fast forward maybe not 2 days later we’re hearing the banging again after trying our best to keep our dog calm and sat, but with the endless hitting of the roof we begin to care less and less and become more annoyed with them as we are try our best to keep our dog quiet and no later than 8:30 too and it’s to be courteous but I will admit I’ve come home at maybe 12 am before and have seen then up and moving almost seems they never sleep, but nonetheless even during the day and afternoon the sound seems still too much and they are constantly complaining.

Since I was really young, I've always wanted a papillon dog (tiny dog with pretty ears for those who don't know).  Even when I was a child and didn't know the breed I would draw that exact dog on my school work constantly.


A few months ago I got a dog, a german shepherd puppy, which caused me to have a panic attack since she was so big and clumsy and I worried she would hurt my cat. With a heavy heart, I had to give her away. I was convinced to consider a other cat instead, but deep down I knew I didn't want another cat. I want to take care of a dog. My sister can do it, why can't I?


The problem now is my mother. She's really upsetting me telling me I can't handle a dog when she knows the reason I freaked out. An adult, small, calm temperament dog fixes the problem, and she recommended the solution in the first place. But now she's saying I can't do it and it's breaking my heart.

One of her littermates had a DNA test done and they are true mutts, but their closest breed matches were Australian Cattle Dog &amp; Boxer. In most aspects, she is a fantastic dog. Loyal, smart, energetic, sweet, and a great big sister to our 5 month old shepherd. 

However, whenever she is let outside she seeks an escape, no matter where or how much space she’s given. We live in the city but have a reasonably-sized fenced in yard. She is CONSTANTLY searching for or creating holes in the fence trying to escape. When she’s at the dog park, which is a massive space of land, she is sniffing the perimeter searching for a way to leave. When we visit my mom, who lives on an acre+ of fenced in land and has other dogs for her to play with, she STILL seeks a way to leave.

When we picked her up for adoption, she was flagged by the agency as a flight risk, which we took to mean she would flee when panicked or scared. We were gentle in our care and have done all we know how to do to make her comfortable. We do not believe she is fleeing from fear, just maybe curiosity and boredom.

She does not lack in enrichment and exercise. She goes for long walks, runs around like crazy in our yard, visits the dog park almost every day, and plays with our other dog 24/7. She eats well, sleeps well, etc.

About 7 weeks ago he hurt his back legs/back. He was outside to pee and he yelped randomly. We brought him to the vet and they said it might be a slipped disk and to keep him off his back two legs as much as possible. For about 3-4 weeks after he couldn’t walk up the stairs in our home and he had some weakness in his back legs. 

He started to get better but was never at 100%. We tried to limit his walking up stairs as much as we could because we wanted him to give his body a chance to heal. 

Then about 6 weeks after the injury he started to get gastro symptoms. He started to throw up and diarrhea. We brought him to the vet and they did a blood test and found that his white blood cells were elevated. He started to recover from the gastro 4 days later but the vet had recommended we put him on antibiotics due to the elevated white blood cells. We started the antibiotics on day 4 of him having gastro like symptoms. On day 5 he started to act more like himself. He had an appetite again and was more or less back to normal except his back legs were still weak. He was back to normal for 6 days then at night he started shaking and wouldn’t eat his food. 

We brought him back to the vet the next day and he had a fever of 104.5. We were sent for X-rays to check for any issues with his hips, legs, and chest and all came back normal. We also did blood work to check for ticks, heart worm and other tick borne illnesses and all came back clear as well. 

The following day he was sent for an ultrasound and he came back all clear as well. However he still had a fever of 104.18. At this point the vet is not sure what can be causing him to be sick. We were given a stronger antibiotic that also has some anti inflammatory in it and just started him on this last night.

I've had my girl now for around a year and a half. I've had her since she was an 8 week old pup and she's an amazing dog. She loves her walks, eats well and have an amazing temperament, but we are unable to take her in the car anywhere. 

My husband has to hold her while I'm driving and she physically shakes and tries to hide her head. It's honestly very upsetting, so she hasn't been in the car for several months as I don't want to subject her to that until I know how to fix the issue. 

Does anyone know of anything I can do myself before I seek help from a professional?",DogAdvice,Shih Tzu shaking in car,
1669447432,self.DogAdvice,True,"So about ten months ago, we adopted a dog from a buddy. Hela is a Shi Tzu mutt mix of some kind that they found on the side of the road in the desert about six years ago- she is now roughly 10 years old.

Long story short- buddy works long hours and so does his wife. Hela stayed in a crate overnight and as long as they were at work. Then buddy got two husky pups- and proceeded to not have time for them either. All of them were crated excessively and often together in one large crate which resulted in Hela getting bullied by the huskies.

It was only after she started losing massive amounts of weight did he bother to think about rehoming her. I should mention this is my husband's buddy- who lived nearly two hours from us so we didn't really see the dogs at all until he brought up his difficulty trying to get a shelter to take her.

She was severely matted, dragged her belly across the floor because she was so scared of everything, and emaciated. It was terrible. We decided to take her home, and we've had her ever since.

We've been approaching things one at a time- earning whatever trust she'll give us, getting her used to being on a leash and going on walks, working on her anxiety- little by little. She's now a healthy weight and still super anxious, but it's not nearly a bad as those first few months. We're working with a vet on maybe getting her medicated to sort out the rest since it feels like her days are just so miserable still.

I'm home most of the day, my husband is Navy so he's gone for fair amounts of time. We take her out every 4-6 hours (no yard) which is what we've found to be her limit for bathroom needs.


However. Nighttime is a different story.

Because of the years of excessive crating, she's unable to be left in a crate. Well, I suppose she could, but she's thrashing, crying, and trying to dig her way out the entire time. We didn't really have an option to not crate her, because she's only partially housebroken and I need to sleep. If not crated, she'll mess in the house. Every time. We've tried crate training too, but there's just no point. It's instant deathly panic every time, even if she's in the room with us while crated. Just seeing the crate changes her mood, and she's not a very happy dog to begin with so it's just heartbreaking.

We've finally decided to give up on it - it's not worth the stress she goes through every day and there's literally nowhere I can put her in the apartment that is far enough that she won't wake me up multiple times a night with her panic.

But. Housebreaking.

She technically is housebroken - she knows that she goes to the bathroom outside. However, she will not tell us if she needs to go. Bell training, touch training- nothing worked. She will not tell us. And she will not hold it either. She just goes. Not an issue during the day, but I need to sleep.

We used puppy pads for awhile, thinking there was some success but then we caught our senior cat using them and we found out we were just teaching HIM to piss on the carpet instead. It took months to fix and get him back to using a litter box. Pads are not an option.

So right now it's pretty much either 1) crate her to prevent messing on the carpet overnight, which will destroy her mental health or 2) accept she will piss on the carpet and that there is nothing to be done, just do our best to carpet clean every week. I'm almost to the point of not caring either way, because this stress combined with everything else is way too much on me. Our senior cat is near the end of his life and taking up most of my time and attention- I don't have much left in me.

I have no idea what options we have left are, except maybe diapers overnight. I don't even know if she'll leave them be, or chew them off. She's fine with her winter jacket, but who knows?

Any ideas or advice would be welcome.",DogAdvice,Complicated housebreaking...,

I don't know why she does this and it's not easy to distract her from doing it. She only seems to do it when she is in the bedroom usually at night, but we also don't watch her while she's outside so i am not sure if she does this during the day.

1669434402,self.DogAdvice,True,"My 1.5 year old Cavalier is great in her crate at night at home. We go for the bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed when we come in, sleeping through the night. 

Whenever I visit my parents, however, it’s a different story. Generally her anxiety levels go up for the first day or two we’re here. I assume that is because sometimes she stays with them when I travel for work, so she’s unsure if I’m staying or going. When I leave her with them she’s totally fine at night. 

The issue is when I am staying at their house. We do her bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed like at home. But minutes later she is barking. The only solution I’ve found is to go sleep on the couch with her for 30mins to an hour and then put her back to bed. (Usually we’ve spent the hours before bedtime laying on the couch watching a movie so it’s not like she’s missing snuggle time!)

This isn’t regulated to my parents’ house. This summer we got a vacation rental (just me and the dog) and it took to night 4 for her to go to bed with no barking.

1669419286,self.DogAdvice,True,"My older dog is acting up, growled and raised his lip at me

We got a puppy(male)  4 months ago and he is now around the half year mark, he is a nice puppy but sometimes can be somewhat annoying, my older dog (3y male) sometimes reminds him of that by growling at him for a brief second until he submits.
My older dog has show no major issues other than dominating the younger dog, never harming the puppy but playing mouthing games or making him submit when he crosses a line( going after his snack, jumping at his face etc.)
The way we feed them is to tell them to go on their bed, afterwards we put their bowls in their spot and give them the command to go after 3-5 seconds)
I normally feed them at the same time, but a recent trend has happened, where my older dog approaches my puppy, ignoring his own food, and growls at him, when this happens i normally separate them and have them eat alone. 
Today though, he started growling at my puppy and making him submit before i even made them go to bed or put the food down. I found this behaviour bad so 
I sent my dog to another room closed the door and fed the puppy. Then i locked my puppy into a different room and tried to feed the older dog. I put his food down and then told him to go on his bed, but instead of doing so he turned towards me, raised his lips and growled at me, I have previously had a negative experience where he nipped me( less than a cm deep) on my arm when I accidentally provoked( i realise what i did wrong there) but this time it seems almost entirely unprovoked.
Im a little bit shocked right now, I would really like some assistance, I have left my older dog alone in the room he normally rats now and closed the door.

This obviously terrifies me. Today was particularly scary as at took multiple attempts before we dislodged the treat and she breathed.

Hi everyone,
I’m really writing this for help on how to cope with this. My 7 year old pomeranian/poodle Nala (my first pet) ate chocolate 2 weeks ago; we took her to the vet where she was then diagnosed with diabetes and lost her eyesight the next day (we had a gofundme set up for that but didn’t raise enough money to restore her sight). Because she was vomiting from the chocolate they put her on a round of antibiotics; she was doing better with the insulin combined with antibiotics, and we took her to the vet yesterday to have a blood glucose monitor installed on her where she was then diagnosed with Pyometra. Her blood sugar is extremely high at 350+ (over what our reader can see) and the pyometra has made her resistant to insulin. For those unfamiliar, pyometra is an infection in the uterus which causes the uterus to rupture this filling the abdomen with pus (where the dog will die in less than a couple of days). We unfortunately don’t have the money for emergency pyometra surgery (ranging from $1-3k) and we’re going to have to put her down within the next week to avoid a super painful eventual death; she has a life expectancy of a couple more weeks with pyometra. I had a gofundme set up for cataract surgery to restore her eyesight, which raised around $330, and was going to use that for her urgent pyometra surgery instead but unfortunately it isn’t enough money and we won’t be able to raise enough within the next week to save her.
I just wanted to know how to cope with this. We have no option but to euthanize her and this has been extremely tough for my family and I as she is our first pet. To anyone whose pet passed away I really would like to understand the grieving process and if it’ll get any easier. It has been hard enough already and it’s only been a day since the news; I hope I had done enough for her with the gofundme and all which didn’t raise much but that was my effort. This was all very sudden as she was happy and healthy just a couple of weeks ago. I’ll be spending my last week with her doing everything she loves.

1669320769,self.DogAdvice,True,"  Howdy. 

I'm a brand new owner of a now 3 month old ""field line"" golden retriever. We are not hunters, just didn't realize goldens..were actually working dogs. Silly me. 

Anyway, I'm not gonna just force her to be a dog she isn't and it's clear already that she has some kind of prey drive or wants to go get birds. We got her from breeders that are hunters, and breed/train for huntin' dogs. 


So I'm wondering what kind of games/tasks are enriching for my ginger. Obviously fetch is a hit.. and I will be getting her a flirt pole. 

Is there anything else I can do to stimulate her retriever brain besides becoming an actual fowl hunter? Lol

Also, she loves to dig. The snuffle mats on Amazon seem lame, I tried one for my 2yo bichon and I just can't see how it's made for digging or even nose work.

I have been considering getting a dog for a long time and ultimately decided to move forward with it because I think it will be beneficial for my health. 

I have CFS, which impacts my health greatly. I’m often drained on energy and it’s often difficult to get out of bed. I do have some good days where I’m able to get outside for a light walk. 

With that being said, I am looking for a breed that does well with my condition. One that will relax with me when not feeling well, but happy to go out on a walk when I can. Additionally, I want a breed that is known not to bark a lot and also doesn’t shed. Size range around 20-40lbs.

A dog that greatly interests me is a welsh terrier. Although I’m not sure if they are too active? I’ve always loved Airedale terriers and this is just a smaller version of them.

I desperately need help. 
I have a 3 year old Aussie who has been having difficulty standing up from laying down for a few months. If I’m being honest I thought he maybe ran or played too hard and that it would pass. He was his normal self besides the struggle to get up, he was still eating and would play with me. Before all of this, I would come home he would be SO excited and jump up on me. Well now, I noticed he stopped jumping up on my bed, stopped jumping on me and barely shows excitement, and is still having major difficulty getting off the ground. Cut to now, he can barely get up, he sits slowly and oddly, he’s very slow when walking, and has no interest in fetch or playing. He seems absolutely exhausted and down, and never wants to get up. Nothing gets him excited and I can tell he is struggling so badly with something or in a lot of pain. I’ve been thinking it was maybe arthritis or something similar. However he’s been to the vet (for allergies) during the time this has been happening and all of his tests and exams were normal. 

My pup has been with my mom who he stays with a lot and adores, and I just got home to see the obvious worsening of whatever is going on. Nothing has changed with his diet or routine except eating less. I immediately notice tonight that he is NOT well and rush him to the ER. You would think he was a very very old dog the way he moves and he was sitting very oddly with both legs pushed to the side. He could also barely get in my car which he never had issues jumping into. 

I explain this in way more detail to the vet. I tell her he is not hisself whatsoever and that I’ve never seen him like this. She checked him out from head to toe and my dog didn’t express any pain in her checks of his body. I told her that he cried today when I was trying to examine his paws and she said he didn’t do that. Basically she said we can do a full body X-ray that would be absurdly expensive, or I go to an orthopedic specialist. I absolutely do not have 1500 to spare for X-rays, especially if that doesn’t show us what we’re looking for. I’m sobbing because seeing him like this is breaking my heart and I may have to find a way to do the X-rays asap because it’s eating me up inside. 

If this sounds remotely relatable to anyone, would you go the X-ray route first? Or maybe other testing? I do not know what to do or where to start especially knowing how expensive all of this will be. I really need some help or peace of mind. 💔",DogAdvice,"Please help - just left vet but so scared, my dog can barely move",
1669259869,self.DogAdvice,True,"Okay so my German shepherd 1y/o was neutered two weeks ago and is still all cone'd up. He's on cone duty another week because he opened the wound a tiny bit the other day (Vet said it was fine, barely opened at all just enough to bleed a teeny bit, gave us antibiotics just in case). Now, we haven't gotten to play very much because he's only interested in playtime that involves running around and getting chased. He comes outside with me whenever I smoke (every hour or so) and we're out there 10, 15 minutes maybe, and he usually does his business then if he needs to. I've seen him hold it nearly an entire day (when we first got him a couple months ago, he was shy in the new home) too so I know he can.

Tonight I found a big ol' dump in the hallway. Like, so big you'd think a human left it there after hitting a buffet. After cleaning, he and I play fetch inside for a bit, since he's mostly healed. I discover a pee puddle that he must've left as a surprise for me earlier. I clean it up and close him out of the room while I do so. When I come out into the hallway guess who's standing over a nice fresh huge NEW puddle of pee? I can understand puddle #2 since he was all excited and I cut him off from playtime abruptly so he might not have been able to control myself, but with the pattern he established over the last few hours it has me concerned.

I also have a couple fish tanks sitting outside full of water to test they won't break. It's cold out, and they're covered in condensation. When I took him out with me like 20 minutes ago, he started nudging and rubbing his nose up against the side of one of the tanks and sort of stumbling side to side. I don't know what he was doing, he wasn't licking it. He might've been trying to check out a bug he saw or something, which would explain a lot because he might've just been stumbling trying to get closer to the bug with the cone in the way, but at the same time what if it's not that, you know? He's being good right now and sleeping in his favorite chair. 

Anyone have any ideas on why? Maybe he's just sick of the lack of stimulation since the neuter and he's acting out with the peeing/pooping inside? And the tank thing was just a bug he saw? Or could this be something more serious?

Urinalysis found suspected bacteria &amp; we were given antibiotics. She toke them for 4 days until the urine culture came back negative in which I stopped. The vet said it was probably not a uti then. During this visit we also did a blood test and x rays but everything was normal except high bilirubin. 

We went back to do another blood test a week or two ago and it’s a different doctor this time (but the same clinic) who is going over the last visit. He mentions something the other vet didn’t which is my dogs urine has a pH of 9 which could indicate a uti. I opted not to do another urinalysis or urine culture because of what the other vet said and just process with blood work. It came back normal. Bilirubin levels were within range. 

These past few days, the drinking water has increased where it’s so noticeable. Few months ago even though I noticed a bit of an increase in intake of water, her pee was still yellow as usual. She generally doesn’t drink that much water anyways. Now it’s like light yellow to clear. And she’s peeing way more often on walks. She’s also gained a few pounds which the 2nd vet noticed.

They have a shock collar on him, but he typically isn't deterred from bad behaviors due to inconsistent conditioning and probably sheer carelessness to just do what he wants. My 4.5 year old nephew is growing a bit scared of him, as the dog constantly barks and lurches toward him when my parents are babysitting. My nephew isn't scared when he's sitting with my parents in a chair, even if the dog is sniffing and licking his feet. The dog will constantly follow around my parents if they are carrying my nephew, sometimes jumping up to smell or lick my nephew. My nephew is at the age where he wants to run around our house with toys creating a ton of ruckus. This agitates/excites the dog. My parents have gates around the house which successfully sequester the dog and nephew. However, this usually leads to the dog watching right at the gate door (or running in between gate doors if my nephew is running around), incessantly barking until my nephew fully leaves the house.

my family and i are fostering (soon to adopt) a senior beagle, he’s 11, and his name is allegedly  “Snoopy.” unfortunately we have little to no information on him, all we know is that his previous owner passed away and the family of the owner wanted to euthanize him. however, in their care, they neutered him at 10 years old. that is all we know about him. from our experience, he is VERY affectionate, he is overweight, he has severe separation anxiety, and he does not respond to his name/commands/sounds. 

we took him to VetCo (petco’s vet, we do not recommend) because we weren’t able to get him into our personal vet yet. anyways, after weeks with that vet, we finally switched and got him into our personal vet. our vet was concerned about Cushing’s disease, and the previous vet had mentioned it too.. because he checks off all the boxes on the symptoms. on top of that, he has chronic ear infections, hearing loss, a heart murmur, and a distant heartbeat (vet said that it’s hard to hear it? it sounds far away… possibly due to him panting  or obesity). we will also have to do a chest X-ray to ensure his lungs and heart are alright. 

i love this dog, he is the sweetest. we put down about $600 or more in vet bills so far, and we plan to put down more to get him tested for Cushing’s disease and X-ray. once they test him, we can get the medication to help give him a quality of life. we are also giving him CBD oil 1-2x daily to help him calm down because his anxiety. 

it just saddens me, knowing that we are going to adopt a dog who’s already a senior, and who’s life could be cut short due to a variety of different reasons. i am also sad because we have another senior beagle, Annie, who is 14 years old too. i know that beagles life expectancy is usually 12-15 years… and my heart breaks just to think about this all.",DogAdvice,my senior foster pup might have cushings disease (i think he 100% does..),image

1669143287,self.DogAdvice,True,"My English Springer Spaniel Roxy (8 years old, female) has been having ongoing digestive issues for about 2 months now. We've been back and forth to the vet many times. This all started around September 25th.

It started out as painful gas. She would cry and pace for an hour to 2 hours. Eventually I'd get her to settle, put the heating pad on her belly and she would pass some really smelly farts and then just go to sleep. It was progressively becoming more frequent so we knew she needed to get into the vet. We called the vet and the first appointment was 2 weeks out. But they prescribed us a probiotic and recommended trying Beano over the counter with dinner and told us to try a bland diet of Chicken and Rice in the meantime.

Then we finally went to her appointment and got her bloodwork and a stool sample analyzed. Stool sample was normal, bloodwork only showed her Phosphate level was a little low, not really conclusive of anything. Vet prescribed a prescription diet Purina Gastro EN and said we could also use Gas X whenever she had an episode. We were slowly transitioning to the new diet and things were looking better. We only had about 3 gas episodes during the transition rather than every single night and whenever an episode was coming on we would give her Gas X and it would resolve in a half hour. So we learned how to treat it, but not what's causing it.

We scheduled an abdominal ultrasound. We lost our last dog really suddenly and wanted to be sure this wasn't something serious. Meanwhile the day before the ultrasound we had almost finished transitioning to the new diet, but suddenly she has diarrhea. So we go back to chicken and rice. She fluctuated between bouts of bad diarrhea and semi solid stool, we are now on day 4 of diarrhea. We have tried fasting for 12 hours. Then small frequent meals of chicken and rice. On day 3 we also added a spoonful of pumpkin. Probiotics in the morning, beano at night. Today we returned to the vet for repeat bloodwork and they gave us Flagyl for the diarrhea. Meanwhile my dad and I also had terrible diarrhea as well. So it's possible that it's a diarrhea bug that we all caught and is actually a separate issue from the gas..

It's a huge relief that her ultrasound was normal and didn't show a tumor or anything. But I'm also frustrated that we have no real answers for what's going on with Roxy. She's lost 7 pounds. I'm frustrated that everyone just keeps telling me to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm frustrated that I called the vet over and over and Roxy had to have diarrhea for four days before someone finally prescribed something.

1669141587,self.DogAdvice,True,"We have recently adopted a second GSD from the shelter (\~2 months ago). At first, the dog (we named him Dog) was acclimating well, learning new tricks and easily house trained. Three weeks ago today, we noticed Dog start to spin while sniffing the ground (bi-directional) and let out a high pitch bark when he completed the turn (not tail chasing). This coincided with the installation of our sod grass that day as well as switching to a new food: Inukshuk. We have tried changing his food back to what he had before the switch to no avail (Orijen Original). A couple days before onset, he finished a month long regimen of Doxycycline for heartworms. Since then, and truly over the course of the first 1-2 days, the behavior has increased in frequency to nearly all day except when he is sleeping. If he goes outside, we cannot distract him from this behavior (balls/ physically trying to move him, etc), and he also pulls up clumps of grass during the spins with his mouth. We are afraid to let him outside because of the noise + destroying our new grass. Indoors, he also spins, yips, and licks the floor/drags his teeth on the flooring while spinning. Sometimes a ball will distract him indoors for a few minutes while he chews on it, but most often he will run to a ball or a toy and then spin cycle once he reaches the ball. He used to have a solid “come,” but he now ignores it while spin-cycling. His vocalizations have also increased to constant, be it whining anxiously or high-pitched yapping most hours of the day. For example, he used to be very calm/happy during a car ride, and you can see in the video I’ve attached anxious vocalizing.   


He is going to the vet next week for a blood panel + heartworm injection. We have called them a couple times about the spin-cycle, and their advice was to redirect, and we have been dedicated to doing so, but it’s nearly impossible at this point to really distract him from the spin-cycle at all, or at least distract him constantly all day. We fortunately both work from home, so we can rule out separation anxiety, and we have the capacity to work with him more than most would be able to. He does this in the crate as well, but instead of licking he digs at the pad.

I was already aware that rawhide was bad for dogs, but as it said 100 percent digestible I just assumed it was made of something else with the rawhide part simply being a marketing ploy.  We have decided to stop giving him the ham bones since those are dangerous, but i was just wondering if the rawhide rolls are also bad? I have seen a couple of different companies do the same thing of saying something is 100 percent digestible rawhide such as better belly, are these claims legitimate or should i just switch to no hide?

1669093123,self.DogAdvice,True,"Obviously my dog is an outside dog. but she has separation anxiety, so she will bark when she wants attention. I train and get her tired and she barely barks during the day until its time to eat dinner. she sometimes wants it early it seems. Thats not the problem though, she is quieter than the other dogs in our neighborhood that are around us and the most behaved big/medium dog on leash.

problem: she likes being outside more than in her crate at night.

explain: when it was warmer i'd have to pet her and then she'd get up to come in and be just fine during the night in her kennel, i dont force her in, she just walks into it with guidence.

now that its cold, we obviously dont want her to freeze outside. she has a dog enclosure she can safely be in with access always to water, a bed, and an igloo. when we bring her in for the night, she goes in as usual and then after a few moments of letting us sleep she starts whinning and barking. at first you'd think ""she just needs water"" or ""she needs a potty break."" well we did both of those, she didnt take the water (when she was a pup she tended to have water at night when she barked which is why i trued it this time) and she went pee. we bring her back in and then a few minutes later she is barking again. we eventually put her outside in the doggy pen and she goes right to sleep on her outside bed, then she wakes up whinning a bit (i assume she forgot it was cold outside til she woke up) and then she goes into her kennel and sleeps the rest of the night perfectly fine.

if we have an anxiety collar from the vet on her, she is better at night inside.

we dont want her to be cold outside. so we prefer her to be inside, but in the last 2 days, she prefers outside. we are working on getting a heating dog bed for her so she isnt cold but it would be nice to know is warmer inside.

her anxiety collar lasts 1 month so after that we have to schedule another, in between those days we dont want to be kept up all night trying to calm her down.

clarify: We do NOT want her outside in the cold. *she* chooses it.

anything we could do?

note: she is 8 yrs old, a Rottweiler, and she has had past seizures due to a mold allergy (affected us too. we moved since then) so the vet said we gotta be careful of the anxiety meds. she had us try some and it gave her a seizure so we stopped and the anxiety collar works great, no seizures.",DogAdvice,My dog likes outside more than inside,

1669083542,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello, I hope someone can help me or give me some advice.. 

I try to make it short and sum everything up.  

My dog is extremely dominant towards other dogs and horribly territorial, I really think that this is an extreme case. I adopted him over a year ago , he‘s 2 years old , castrated and 17 pounds (tiny) , don‘t know his breed, he‘s a mix, but really really beautiful and cute and looks like an angel actually but if he gets angry, he turns into a devil. 

The first months were horrible, he became more and more reactive, went totally crazy when we came close to other dogs, he barked at everything and got aggressive towards me in those moments of rage. I was so so desperate, we live in the city and there are so many dogs here, it was impossible to avoid them completely. Going on a walk with him was horrible, at home I spent my time watching videos and reading stuff etc, I was so exhausted.. i couldn‘t afford a dog trainer or anything so I had to do it on my own, I tried several stuff from counter conditioning, worked a lot with treats, in the end I did a mixture of everything and it got better with time.. 

so now I can go on a walk with him and actually enjoy it (at least most of the time). He gets alonh well with little dogs , females in general , he‘s extremely dominant though and also insecure, sometimes even anxious towards little dogs which is absurd, because when he see‘s a bigger male dog (not castrated worst case) he gets totally wild and its difficult for me to control him. 
In most cases I can handle him very well but there is particularly one dog which is his hate object nr 1 and he becomes this evil rage machine , it‘s really scary actually. I can‘t call it aggression because it doesn‘t describe it at all. In that state I cannot do much. I tell him to STOP It, try to make him sit, making eye contact , which works with other dogs that he doesn’t like but not with his hate objects (that one dog and especially huskies) Even when the dog is not in sight anymore he marks the ground like crazy , growling at the same time, raised hair from neck to tail… 

today we had this encounter in the morning, he went wild, I tried but couldn‘t control him, he bit me in the leg. I was so angry and so sad because I thought that we passed that shit already, it was a huge relapse. most people find it funny when he gets angry because he‘s little and cute , he always has this beauty bonus. In the first months I always tried to find excuses for this behaviour(he‘s traumatized etc , he was abandoned) but I think it‘s his extremely dominant attitude which has nothing to do with the past. On the other hand he‘s the cutest dog, he really is. 

What is really concerning for me is the level of rage and aggression , he goes from 0 to 10000, it also happened that he got along well with a dog and all of a sudden he got mad and attacked the other dog without any warning. He’s so unpredictable and I’m afraid that he could seriously harm another dog. Of course other owners find it funny because “cute little dog gets angry“ “don‘t worry, it‘s ok“.. no it‘s not. another big problem is the vet. We were three (!!!) people trying to control and hold him for one vaccine. I don‘t know what happens if he gets ill and needs treatment … even the vets said it to me “this is not normal. We have seen extrem cases of nervous and anxious dogs at the vet.“ 

I tried to get him used to a muzzle, we trained that but he gets paralized as soon as he wears it, he wouldn‘t move .. i don‘t think that wearing a muzzle is the solution, I wish it was. He also rejects any kind of collar, he turns into a depressed thing, he only wears a harness for walks. Don‘t know what he went through and why he hates other dogs so much. 
At home he‘s cute and I‘m happy with him, he sleeps at his place, no begging at the table (of course he tries but he goes back to his place when I tell him) , no destruction or aggression problems, he waits for my commando to start eating , no extrem barking only when excited for something.. one vet said to me that I should not give him affection, no petting, no cuddling, only one place for him, all rooms forbidden, basically only nos nos nos.. i mean, this is not the solution right? We have rules, like I wrote above, but I don‘t think that something would change for the better if I stopped petting him. 

I hope this wasn‘t too much.. it would be nice to hear other experiences , maybe someone knows something, I would appreciate that alot! Thank you!!",DogAdvice,extremely dominant and aggressive dog,

My dog (1.5 year old hound mix) has had on/off scabbing on the tip of his ear for the past few months.

However she doesn’t play fetch with any toy I tried, she doesn’t play with other toys she has, the two things she likes are dog parks (even then she is picky with the dogs there) or playing/running/walking with me. I usually walk her 3 miles a day and take her to the park for min an hour on top of that. However with winter coming up and daylight savings time, it’s now dark when we wake up and dark when I get home, I tried the dog park but there’s nobody there after sunset, and to top it off coyotes have been coming into the city and I’m scared to venture far in the dark.

So I finally caved in, did my research and found a good daycare. But I don’t know how to go about this. My dog and I have never been really apart, I occasionally ask friends to dogsit her but always at my place.

I have a 2.5 year old pug. Ever since the day we brought him home he’s “humped” normally once a day lol. He has a blanket that he likes to hump and he’s just always done it. Yes he still needs to be neutered, he’s never around other dogs but we still need to for health purposes.

Anyways, we went on a 4 day trip where we boarded him at the same place we always do, and he seems to do just fine there. Last time we picked him up, they told us he was humping his bed alot but this time they did not. We’ve now been back for 7 days and he has not humped his bed or blanket at all.

He is generally sweet and well behaved but he is a territorial barker and doesn’t really understand why so many people live right outside of our house. He has never attempted to bite anyone but he can sound very scary when he barks. He will pull on the leash and bark. We have has a few run ins with the next door neighbor and us leaving at the exact same time because our doors are 2 feet apart. 

Anyways she is fed up and scared of him even though he’s never done anything- she is claiming he’s tried to bite her on multiple occasions and reporting animal control because she claims we have no control over him. In my opinion this is just a straight up lie, but I could imagine how an aggressive sounding dog that we are holding on the leash might seem like he’s “trying to bite” when he’s pulling towards you. We have introduced them in the past and he always tries to hide behind us when she gets close. 

Regardless though, I want to be a better neighbor and curb my dogs excessive barking and territorial attitude because I’m aware it’s obnoxious as hell for everyone.

1669034602,self.DogAdvice,True,"TL;DR leave my dog at an Airbnb close by, doggie daycare, or leave him at home but he’ll be alone for longer periods of time. 


Christmas is coming up and I’m still trying to figure out what would be the best way to take care of my dog while at family gatherings. Will be going to one family function on Christmas Eve, and another on Christmas Day. They are both close to each other, but far enough from my house that we will likely be staying over at my mom’s house for the two days.



My dog is quite well behaved when visiting other people, but can’t go to the Christmas Eve gathering because they have cats, and he can’t come to the Christmas Day because my sister has pretty bad allergies and a small baby, and is also scared of Coop a bit (he’s very sweet but very big and very hairy). I could probably fight to bring him but I don’t want my sister to be uncomfortable at Christmas.



Anyway, I’m not really sure what I’m going to do with my dog. He is really good 99% of the time, but will sometimes steal something and resource guard it, so I don’t feel comfortable leaving him at a daycare. We once got a friend to watch him for a week while we were on vacation and he was so bad, that my friend was literally scared of him and we had to get a family member pick him up midweek. (Had a different friend watch him once but that friend I guess was experienced with resource guarding so was able to handle it). But it seems like he acts up when he’s with unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. He usually is watched by my partners family when we go away (he grew up with them in that house so they never have any trouble) but they are going to be at the Christmas Eve gathering, and will have their own thing on Christmas Day. 



My mom has offered to watch him while we are away for Christmas Eve, but then I’ll still need to find somewhere for him to go on Christmas Day. 



Options are: I have booked a dog friendly Airbnb near my mom’s house that we could bring him to so we can easily go and visit / walk him a few times that day. Im just worried he will be really stressed in an unfamiliar house by himself and destroy something (he’s hasn’t had separation anxiety at our house). 



Or we leave him at our place and just go home each night but Coop will be by himself for two full days and I don’t think that’s really fair for him. 



There are also “doggie suites” in my mom’s area, sort of like a daycare, but alone. But you have to do a consultation as well as a “doggie daycare trial”, so we’d have to get that done before the holidays start. 



Ideally, my mom’s friend lives practically next door and we could potentially leave Coop there (she has a dog as well so it’s all dog proofed), but only if she is away for Christmas because while our dogs do get along, it’s still always a risk with two dogs in the same house. But it would be so nice if we could use her house because we could pop in and out super easily throughout the day and my family loves a Christmas walk.

I’ve never had a dog before… the largest animal I’ve had is a cat… and I don’t want to mess things up. So… help? 

I plan to take her to the vet tomorrow for a check up, and to see if she has one of those scanner ID chips implanted. If not, I’ll post flyers around my neighborhood to see if anyone is missing her. 

She was terrified, starving, and smelled like stale urine when we found her. And she’s got a kind of rust-colored rash under her neck where a collar should’ve been. She hasn’t really made any noise, and is incredibly sweet. She stopped shaking from fear after the bath, and even managed to have some playful tippy taps when she met my cat (who is not amused). 

No idea what breed she is… see the Imgur album below.

We have a four year old Shiba Inu named Chai. We have had him since he was 8 weeks old, and he is generally a very good boy. Of course, being a shiba, he has his ‘quirks,’ but when it comes to training and behavior, he has been a very good boy for four years now. 

He has also usually shown to be very adaptable. We have moved a couple of times since we got him, and he has also adapted through a lot of job/routine changing. He has always readjusted extremely quickly and well, honestly he’s really a trooper. 

But, out of nowhere ( for him ), he’s starting to act out. I’d like to ask you all to keep open and understanding minds as you read this! And know that I have years of experience with dog owning and training, and I know ‘objective’ solutions for some of the issues we’re having — im just a little stressed and overwhelmed and wondering if anyone has any constructive insight!

We recently moved again, about two months ago now. And in fact, the place we moved into provides a much nicer situation for Chai. And as he usually does, he adjusted very very quickly to the new place! He was doing amazing. 

Until I started my new job, about three weeks ago. Before this, I worked a full time job, and Chai was very used to being in a crate when I was at work — my new job is no different. 

But since the very first night after starting my new job, Chai has been whining in his crate. He has /never/, truly never, done that before. Not even a couple years ago when our life was extremely unstable and we had almost no routine. Now, we are stable, and we do have routine — but Chai seems to have almost regressed? 

Since my fiancé is at home most of the time, Chai pretty much only has to be crated at night. I wait until the last possible minute before I go to bed to put him in there, giving him as much time outside of the crate as I can. He usually doesn’t go to bed til at least 1 am. I’ll even stay up later than I should just for his sake, since he suddenly hates being in there so much. He whines immediately when he goes in, and goes on for about an hour or so. And then, he whines again at like five in the morning, and continues to do so off and on until I get up. 

I’ve tried getting up to let him go potty, and then locking him back up, and he’ll keep whining, so I know that isn’t the problem. 

And again, this only started when I started working again. For the first month in the new house, he didn’t make a peep in his crate, no fuss whatsoever — which is his normal. But now he’s not only keeping himself awake with the whining, but he’s disturbing our sleep too, and I work a very mentally and physically exhausting job — needless to say, I’m definitely getting frustrated and confused. And very tired lol. 

Today, he has absolutely blown my mind with a new ‘regression.’ We use the Place command for him for when we aren’t able to supervise him — if one of us is nearby and can keep sort of an eye on him, he does as he pleases. But when we’re preoccupied and in a different part of the house, we put him on Place. Just like with his crate, he has always been an extremely good boy for years about this. He has always seemed to even enjoy the routine, he gets excited to go on Place and he loves to curl up and snooze. 

But today, he has broken Place /four/ times in a row. The first time I wrote off as a fluke, thought maybe he needed to pee, but I still put him back on Place and released him myself, let him outside for a while, and then put him back. 

A few minutes later, I heard the clicking of his claws on the floor, and I was a little flabbergasted. He really /never/ does this. I put him back on Place. 

This has happened two more times. He doesn’t seem to be attempting to do anything specific when he gets up, like he isn’t going to the door to get out, he isn’t sniffing around the kitchen like he does when he’s hungry. He’s just trotting around or lying on the couch or something aimless. 

I know I’ve rambled on, and I know, being a dog group, people will have some most likely strong, owner-attacking opinions 💚 ( I’ve worked with dogs and dog people for over ten years, and I know how dog people are — especially on the internet! ) I just ask, again, that you guys try to understand that I know my dog, I know how to work with dogs, and I know logical solutions to these problems. I’m just struggling to understand where they’re coming from. I have never ever expected a ‘perfect’ dog, there’s no such thing, and I’ve always been very understanding of the misbehaviors he has normally has throughout his life. But these new things, his very sudden crate training and place training regressions, are important things and they’re very tiring. If this were a new dog, or a dog I didn’t know, or a dog who I know has had bad experiences with these things ( etc ), it would make a lot more sense to me. But Chai has only ever known crate and place training, and if anything, those two routines have been the more consistently stable things that he knows!",DogAdvice,Four year old dog suddenly acting out?,

We go on solo walks all the time and I introduce her to other people and other dogs. She's a little nervous around dogs but LOVES people. But sometimes she'll see (not meet) one person and just decide she doesn't like them. She doesn't pull or lunge. Just a clear sort of ""stay away from me"" bark. But it's so rare. Not even once a day that I'm confused on how to handle it. It's not even the same look, race, gender or clothing that sets her off though they trend more towards elderly women. And not even the same person every time. I've kinda of just let it slide as far as training. I apologize and we'll move to the side to let that person go through. Dogs are beings too right? They're gonna just not like someone sometimes like I do. But because she locks onto that person she doesn't like, it spooks them a bit. She'll do her one warning barking and then as they walk past she'll bark a 2-3 time more if I don't redirect her. Again, no lunging or anything. I often use treats to break her attention. But is that the best option? Because I am unsure how I can decrease her random, yet infrequent reactivity and make her more comfortable.

Final thing is her ""confirmation"" barking. She's otherwise very quiet and I live in an apartment. She sleeps in the bed with me and when I give her the command to come up to the bed at night, she does a single loud bark and comes over. Like a ""okay I hear you."" or ""On my way!"" thing.

My daughter and her GF tried speaking to the family there, but a language barrier prevented any meaningful dialogue, and they were eventually told to leave.

1668985065,self.DogAdvice,True," Hi  everyone. I have a two-year-old lab. She's a wonderful dog. She was a  joy to train and i feel that I have very clear lines of communication  with her. She has a very balanced temperament (even though she was a  little timid in her first year) and handles 98 percent of interactions,  both with humans and dogs, very well. She has never bitten or shown  signs of aggression in any form other than what i describe below. She  also has a pretty rock solid recall. All in all, a very well-behaved and  good-natured lab. Not untypical.

However, lately a problem has emerged and i don't really understand what causing it or what to do about it when it happens.

I  should say firstly for context that i'm from the UK and this happens  while off lead in the park. In UK parks, it's generally permitted and  understood that dogs will be off lead. There are very few dog specific  parks. The park in question is very, very large.

In  short - Very occasionally, she will charge and bark at people. I know  that she would never attack, but of course the people on the receiving  end do not. She has a pretty scary bark and when she bares her teeth I  appreciate that she could be pretty frightening. She will charge and  stop 5 feet from them, take the space, hackles up and intensely bark a  few times and then return to me. It strikes me very much as 'get away  from us!'. When it happens, she ignores her 'Stop' command (which  usually makes her stop and sit immediately) and ignores her recall  command. This usually all happens in 5 seconds or so.

I've  noticed a few common triggers - People who are concealed and then  reveal themselves, for example, from behind a tree. Also people who are  behaving erratically. Occasionally (and hugely embarrassingly) people  whose faces are covered with veils. It also happens when people have bad  energies. For example, sometime i will spot someone a little physically  intimidating or something walking towards us and even though i don't   change my behaviour or signal my nervousness to her, she picks out the  same person and barks.

I think  there is a logic to it from her perspective. It seems pretty defensive  in nature. However, in my book, this is unacceptable and there is no  excuse. Especially to ignore her stop and recall commands.

Do any of you guys have any thoughts on what this new behaviour might be about and how to best deal with it when it occurs?

Thanks so much.

1668980253,self.DogAdvice,True,"Recently got a 2month old golden retriever, I have a 2 year old Bichon who is admittedly not socialized but is other wise very well behaved save for some of the basic commands we just never taught her. 

2 year old has never dealt with other pups besides her littermates, obviously. I don't know what her relationship was like with her mom or the backyard breeders we got her from.


2 month old comes from what seemed to be reputable breeders, they checked off most of the ""ethical breeder"" checklist. The breeder warned us that Golden is ""anti-social"" and likes to have her own space. She seemed worried we wouldn't like that and really encouraged us to get the other pup. 


Personally, I don't see any insecurity or aggressive habits in this new puppy. She is just a typical puppy with shark teeth and learning boundaries. She is quiet ""introverted"" , however, and regularly get irritated with our Bichon being too close. 


Bichon is usually high energy during playtime, darts around and wants to go hard. So for a while we had to remove *her* because she was overwhelming pup. 

Now, it's the Golden we have to keep separated from Bichon because all she wants to do is *bite*. My Bichon has completely kept a distance, sits with my husband or in another corner and is incredibly tolerant of Golden when she does get a hold of her tail or lip. 



They do want to play at times. But I feel like I can't let them because Bichon will just get bitten. It's like the first thing my Golden wants to do.. and I don't know that my Bichon has it in her to ""correct"" or teach bite inhibition because I can't let them play for longer than two seconds. 

My Bichon has actually gotten an *eye* infection because Golden always goes for the eyes.


Like, I don't think I can let them even sniff each other unless they are about to go to sleep. 

Am I hindering behavioral development and their relationship if I keep them separated at all times? My Bichon wouldn't hurt the Golden, I'm worried she'll lose an eye. 

I do try to play with Bichon separately but she is just SO obsessed with Golden that she won't play with me. 

What could I be doing wrong here? Should I just keep them separated until pup is older?

Then this morning when I woke up I saw that he peed and pooped near the door.. Then while i was in the shower he peed AGAIN on his bed. This is very odd behavior, I am a little worried. He’s been eating, drinking and sleeping (acting normal). I don’t know if i’m just over thinking but i don’t know. Last night he also started this thing with his mouth, like it was something bothering him. Almost if you got a piece of food stuck in your braces. He just kept trying to get something out, moving his tongue around oddly and even tried using his paw to get “it” out. Not sure if it’s a coincidence or really something. What’s going on? Or what possibly could be going on?? Should I take him to the vet?",DogAdvice,Dog has been acting weird (Don’t be rude).,

1668965326,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello all. Yesterday, my wife and I brought home a foster-to-adopt rescue. She is an 8-10 month old Anatolian Shepard who is 16 days post-op single rear leg amputation. She was found as a stray and transferred to the local SPCA where they determined her rear leg injury was irreparable and required amputation at the hip. We were told that they also performed a Spay procedure prior to the amputation. They did not send us home with any pain medication for her which I found odd, as I can only imagine she is still hurting. We did get Trazedone but from my understanding, that has no pain-killing effect and only serves to keep her calm. She has displayed anywhere from mild to moderate aggression towards my wife and one of our other dogs. All were seemingly random woth no common themes as to what would cause it. My wife tried adjusting her e-collar prior to bed and she gave a defensive bark and a attempted snap. That was the worse aggression display thus far with the other being mild towards my other dog. He will be minding his own business and she will start quietly growling as if she's just annoyed he's there. She has yet to show any aggression towards me or our other, oldest dog.

1668957863,i.redd.it,True,"Some context about my dog Buttercup who is the predominant cause for this post; she's a Pitbull-Boxer mix with some other stuff in there somewhere, about 6~7yrs old, and the sweetest dog ever when it comes to people, other dogs, and cats. We've had her since she was 2yrs old and she was a mommy before we adopted her.

Her favorite game is playing Tug of War, especially when you get competitive and make her fight for it and play keep away. Ever since I've started playing Tug with her, (when I was 14 and we had just gotten her) to this day, I've slowly become more and more rough and competitive when playing with her. I don't mean that as in being mean to her, but rather, making it harder for her to ""win"" and play fighting. While playing, I'll frequently shove her around, pick her up and swing her via her holding onto the toy, and get her in face growling and wrestling with her. She has never ever intentionally HURT me while playing like this, only nipped at my hand accidentally or lightly (didn't break skin or truly BITE me) when I really deserved it.

I wanted to make this post because I'm wondering if it's safe to play with her like this. Soon as we stop playing, she'll be sweet and gentle as always, and she seems to genuinely enjoy the rough housing and competition. But is there any chance playing with her like this could be teaching her to be aggressive, even when it seems like she's having fun and still sweet as always? And I'm also concerned if there's any chance giving her a tough time and doing stuff like swinging her up into the air while she holds onto the toy has any chance of causing any serious harm to her neck, teeth or spine. I love playing rough with her and me and her both seem to genuinely enjoy it, but if it might hurt her or cause her to become aggressive I'd like to tone it down.

TLDR; I play rough with my Pitbull-Boxer and she seems to have fun and remain the sweetest dog ever, but I want to ask if it's bad to do this and if it could possibly injure her.",DogAdvice,Questions about playing rough and neck safety,image

I have two dogs of working breed. I have had them since they were 3 months old and raised them to be very social at the dog park. They did well socially but earlier this year they spent about 6 months with my dad's dog who would chew them up and bully them. Since getting them back, they are very quick to snap if other dogs get into their face and try to bite strangers patting them on the lead.

These are behaviours they didn't used to display. I think they've experienced trauma and I want to help them get comfortable with greeting new dogs again.

1668933192,self.DogAdvice,True,"Apologies for the long post. My dog (14 month old Romanian rescue) is constantly over threshold when outside, as in he will bark at nothing, whine, lunge and growl on a constant basis. He’s aggressive towards dogs and people. No aggression issues with visitors to the home. Generally speaking, he’s content in the home (apart from barking). I’m not exaggerating when I say he will spin and bark at the top of his lungs at nothing. I understand he will smell things I can’t but this is 80% of the time outside. 

Neurological condition: I got him at 6 months old but was unaware he was suffering from a spinal subluxation - before the vets thought attacks were “anxiety” - he was hospitalised, had spinal surgery, crate rested for three months. I’ve taught him to walk and do all of his basic functions again. Last month he was discharged from the neurologist and physiotherapist. No brain damage has occurred, only neurological deficit is his mild ataxia. 50% of the time I’ve had him he’s not been allowed outside. 

I’ve worked with a trainer and two behaviourists and have seen zero improvement. In fact, due to spending most of his time inside as he will immediately freak out, he’s worse. Both say he can’t meet other dogs without using graded exposure, but have people had success muzzling their dog and letting them meet a calm dog? He used to live with dogs in Romania but now he can’t see/smell one without wanting to kill it. 

Medication: is on gabapentin and fluoxetine, no change from either. Vet wants to prescribe trazodone but has admitted they have no idea. Seems weird to me because he’s ataxic. I live in UK and have been told Zoloft is seldom used. We use diazepam occasionally but limited impact. Do people have positive experiences with Zoloft ? Considering a veterinary behaviourist but we’ve spent over £15,000 on vet bills. It’s absurd.

I’m attempting to contact other behaviourists but all say the same thing: do gradual graded exposure. Yes, in theory that’s great, but there’s no starting point. The others suggest using a muzzle to shut his mouth so he can’t bark and then click train (wtf is wrong with people) or using a collar for corrections. He can’t use a collar due to his surgical implant. 

If positive behaviourists don’t help, medication so far hasn’t helped and my vet/current behaviourist don’t know what to do, what is left? 

I live next to the beach so it’s a challenging area to control due to dog/foot traffic. I currently attempt training at stupid hours of the day in an attempt to avoid triggers, but he still barks at nothing. I love him so much but attempted to rehome him for his own good, I’ve even contacted specialists who run facilities for dogs who can’t be homed, all have said no because he would be bullied due to his condition. I know this isn’t a good environment for him but for understandable reasons people and organisations won’t take him. I feel forgotten. 

I’m constantly heartbroken and the last 8 months have made me severely depressed. I’m considering euthanasia but don’t want to do it. I saved his life and am his rock.

The first day I brought the puppy home they were fighting for 8 hours and I had to take work off the next day cause i literally got no sleep with them. Since then the fighting is slowly getting to be less, but it is still fairly constant. 

Most of the time the fighting is playful. But after hours it still gets annoying. My older dog has gotten mean a couple times but that gets shut down immediately. Even after wearing each other out completely one of them will walk by the other and they start fighting all over again. 

I try separating them sometimes so they can get “breaks” but this is not realistic to do constantly. I will give them distractions like toys or kongs but as soon as they don’t want those anymore it’s back to the same thing. They wear each other out until they are basically passing out from exhaustion and falling asleep very easily. I just don’t know how they sleep for 20 mins and are back at it again.

He’s a neutered Australian Shepherd (possibly mixed, but idk) and has always been very calm and not one to really play. He was a medical alert dog for his former elderly owner who passed away which is why I took him in. He was very under socialized and over weight, so it took a lot of training and attention to get him healthy and used to being around other dogs. He’s now very social, loves to walk and exercise, but again, doesn’t play with toys. I work from home, so every day we walk the beach and he gets a lot of mental and physical stimulation with me, my husband, and my kid. If I go anywhere, he usually comes with me, and only shows anxiety when I have to leave him. He loves everyone in the family, but he’s MY dog, and basically my shadow. I’d describe him as a Velcro dog.

Over the last few weeks, he has been getting really antsy in the evenings to the point where he will play with toys with me. It’s been really nice to see his playful side, since every time I think about him being 12 I get really sad, since I know Aussies usually live 13-15years. He has no current health issues and his vet says he’s in very good shape for his age.

Here’s the (possible) issue: when we get into playing, or when he sees me play with my daughter, he starts trying to hump me. He has never done this before to people or dogs. When we used to go to dog parks, he was always submissive. If I’m sitting on the floor he starts digging around my legs and eventually pulls my leg towards him and mounts up. Even when I move away he’ll keep humping the air until I scratch his back and then he kinda snaps out of it. I try to keep the playing to fetch, since any tug of war or wrestling type play gets him humping.

I’m the only does it to me, nobody else. My concern is that this behavior could be a result of a health issue or could lead to a more concerning behavioral issue.

Tonight I was walking my dog. Unfortunately, I can't avoid his house, so I have to pass by his dogs with my dog, who makes them bark, which sometimes leads them to fighting. Just like every time, when me and my dog passed by they both ran to the rails and started barking and then, they started fighting. One put the other down but I paid them no mind. I just moved on because I have seen them fighting before.

However, when my dog and I returned from our walk about 30 minutes later what I saw concerned me. One of the dogs, the one who was down, was still lying there and the other was standing on top of him doing nothing just standing there. When the one still standing saw us he ran to the rails to bark at us just as he usually does but the other did not move. The other dog kept laying there only moving his eyes to look around. When I walked closer, I saw blood on the side of his neck. I couldn't tell how bad the wound was because it was dark but the dog moving nothing but his eyes looking scared makes me believe it was quite bad. 

My neighbor is not home. He's usually away during the weekends and he returns on Monday or Tuesday. I have no way to contact him because I don't know his number and despite searching him on social media I couldn't find any profile matching his name and face (sounds creepy but I thought I could try reaching him on Facebook or something)

I went by his house 15 minutes ago. The wounded dog is still laying there and he now moves his head a little bit still looking very scared, while the other, the one that bit him, is lying next to him (it looks like he is protecting him/staying on his side but I am not expert). 

So, what do I do? Can I call anyone? The dogs are pretty aggressive to anyone trying to enter their territory, so I doubt anyone can approach them. I thought about calling the police but what if they put the dogs down? And if my neighbor finds out I called the police to his house while he was away, he is going to get angry and he is not a person one can reason with. 

I have contacted a group of volunteers who help dogs in my town but they haven't answered my messages yet. 

Is it possible the dog could die from the bite during the night? Should the dogs be separated? What am I supposed to do in cases like this? I feel helpless. Should I just contact the police and hope for the best? (according to the law here, the police can intervene in cases of animal abuse and they can take the animal away).",DogAdvice,Just witnessed my neighbor's dogs getting into a fight and one of them seems pretty wounded.

1668884863,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello! I have and 11 1/2 year old great dane. Recently, he has been exhibiting a signs of deafness (not listening, excessively vocal). I originally thought he was just getting stubborn in his old age. However, over the past few weeks I started thinking he might be deaf because he wouldn't even notice when visitors were at the house. It seemed happen almost overnight. He went to the vet and she said there was some fluid in his ear and performed a hearing test (making a sound behind him with a chime?) which she said he didn't respond to. She said it was likely due to age. I wasn't the one who actually took him to the appointment so I'm not sure why nothing could be done regarding getting rid of the fluid or what it was from.

I feel like he can still hear to some degree though. If I say ""do you want to go for a walk?"" Or ""do you want to go for a ride?"" He gets attentive and turns his head to the side like he always has. This works even if he isn't looking at me. 

So does this mean he can still hear to some degree or is he detecting familiar vibrations? Like right now he is napping next to me and I said his name.. He seemed to twitch a little but didn't wake up.

1668874641,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello. I have a major dilemma here and maybe someone could give me insight on my thoughts to solve it. I would like to not have to rehome my dog by any means.  But. 

I am looking at starting a career change.  I’ve hit a sudden and unexpected brick wall in my life and things are about to change dramatically.  Where I currently work I take the dog to work with me.  She is almost never ever alone as she goes everywhere with me work or not.  This job is unexpectedly ending.  As a result I am looking at relocating to a new city, and starting a career as a plumber which is something I’ve wanted to get into.  Apprentices do not make much for the first or second year.  I’d be selling my home and besides apprentice salary, be living from the house sale until my monthly income gets higher and I’m once again in the green.  At which point I’d probably down payment a house with what I have left.  

The dilemma is that to keep the dog I am going to have to leave her home during the day.  I can probably spend the 200-300 a week hiring someone to come in halfway through the day and give her a walk.  I’d also walk or run her before and after work.  This would get expensive, but I could do it assuming by year two or 3 of apprenticeship my salary would increase and I’m not at a deficit each month.  Without the dog, I wouldn’t be in a deficit at all.  

But the money is only one thing I worry about.  The main thing is leaving her alone so much.   I hate the idea as she’s never spent much time alone.  There is a co worker currently who has a family with kids and a dog who might be open to taking her.   The dog absolutely loves this guy and she also loves kids and other dogs.  His wife is stay at home.   Kids are homeschooled.  She would have a good life.

We have noticed for the past month or so when we tell her to go outside for a pee before bed she has turned around and snapped if we attempted to touch her, so we don't touch her we just raise our voice and she relents and goes outside to pee. I felt awful when this happened as I never want to put her in a situation where she feels like she needs to bite, so I don't.

She's been going to the same groomer every month since we got her and they always say she has been difficult to groom and hates all of it, but never any aggression. I tried to help her by bathing her at home sometimes, using the hairdryer etc and she's great with me. I bring her with me into a small room in the house where she can't escape my hairdryer and I don't need to hold her or force anything. We play with toys while I dry her and she doesn't care.

Today they were trying to dry her, one person had the dryer and the other was holding her still and attempted to put a towel over her (apparently they do this to calm them but I've never heard of it). She 'freaked out', turned around and bit the groomer. She didn't break the skin but bit her quite hard.

1668820662,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi, I'm not totally sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice. I have a 5 year old female husky that I've had since she was 7 weeks old. Of course like most huskies she's pretty high energy, and has always chewed on and destroyed toys since I got her. Her favorites tend to be string toys (that I monitor bc she's bad about trying to eat the string), stuffed animals (that I get very rarely bc she destroys them so fast and makes a huge mess), and cardboard, which she mostly just likes tearing up.

Back at the end of July I made a big move. This was clearly pretty hard on my dog. I lived with someone else before and there was another dog in the house that we got when she was about 3 months old, a female border collie. This border collie lived with us and my husky for 3 years (we got her when my husky was 2). 

When I moved the border collie went with the other person. I moved into a much smaller place and simply could not handle two dogs right now, especially two high energy dogs. 

Not only has my husky become a lot more anxious and needy (she clings to me and follows me room to room, which she never did before. She's affectionate but never like this) but she basically won't touch her toys anymore. I even got her a stuffed animal when we got here and even now months later it's intact. She licks it sometimes but that's about it. 

She eats and drinks normally, was in total health last time i took her to the vet, she still loves to go on walks and play with other dogs when I can manage to get her to a dog park, but she will not touch her toys. 

The combination of the anxiety and lack of interest in toys has me a little worried since she hasn't gotten better in all this time. It also makes caring for her pretty difficult as she seems to struggle to entertain herself at all and wants attention from me, and especially exercise, 24/7. I do what I can but I have my own stuff to do, and quite frankly some days after having already walked her a few miles and trying to play with her (which she's not really up for at my apartment either) I don't have the energy or interest in more play time. 

I'm going to be in this apartment for a while longer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to what I could do to get her to actually play with her toys again. I've tried rotating her toys, tried getting her new things(new rope toy, stuffed animals, rubber ones) but the only ones she has any interest in are new bones, and even those she gets bored of pretty quickly. I can't exactly afford to just constantly buy her new bones she barely even makes a dent on anymore every week.

For the past three days, he's been regurgitating some or all of his food a few minutes after eating. Not every time, but at least once per day. It's not always all of his food (sometimes it is) but 50-75%. He is pooping like normal, has plenty of energy, drinking normally, and doesn't seem lethargic at all. He is acting completely normal, other than the regurgitating. He also has a slow feeder, but I'm not sure if it's actually effective at slowing him down since it's the same bowl he's had since he was a puppy.

They were so hyper and excited that they only fell asleep around 2am. Since then they’ve been a lot calmer but there’s been a slight incident. My bf’s Doberman was smelling my dogs bum and my dog went to do the same thing when my bf’s dog just snapped at him and bit him as a warning.. it’s the first time that’s happened. My dog was fine. It just also happened a second time, out of nowhere my bf’s dog just snapped at my dog and now he’s just by my side, sitting down underneath my chair &amp; not walking around anywhere. Whenever my bf’s dog comes close to him, he just puts his belly up. My dog is just staying by my side and I can see he’s scared.

1668803569,self.DogAdvice,True,"So we adopted a shelter dog in 2019, she was fully potty trained, never made any accidents, knew tricks, etc. the only issue we faced was she had separation anxiety and she couldn’t be left home alone in a cage . 
We came home and  she had peed on herself, had saliva covering her body and her cage. So we never left her in a cage after that. 
Just recently we’ve noticed that whenever no one is home, even for an hour, she pee’s. It’s only in one area of our home and it’s ALOT of pee. We do let her outside before we leave but that never helps. She’s never done this before and has been left home alone countless times and this never was an issue. Like I said It’s only when she’s left alone for any period of time. 
I’m scared we may have to get rid of her because she will not stop peeing, our floors are peeling up from how much she is peeing on the floors.

My bf has three dogs, two of which are large 9 month old picardy spaniels (littermates) who live in a 10x20 dog run (the other dog spends the day in his parents backyard). All of his dogs are outside dogs, but he allows one of his favorites to sleep inside every night. He has never had an indoor dog before. He got the two large Picardy’s as 8 week old puppies and pretty much put them immediately in the dog run. They haven’t been trained at all and they get minimal attention. They don’t even have a dog house big enough for one of them, let alone both. They bark constantly and they jump like crazy, especially if anyone is near the fence. (They get so wild to the point that I’m nervous they will hurt themselves.) He says they have plenty of toys but I’ve never seen them. He also tells me that he lets them out of the run and gives them lots of space to roam around a few times a week. I told him they should sleep inside, especially since his other dog gets to and he says “they’re fine” because all of his life he has had outside dogs and they were “fine”. We live in the south, so I get it, it’s not *that* cold, but it’s just not right, and surely cant be comfortable. I just think he has a totally different view on dogs. To me, he treats them like an accessory. Meanwhile, I have four dogs who are a little spoiled. Mine are all well trained and allowed on the couch with me and sleep in bed next to me. 
His excuse for not letting them inside is that they are dirty, smelly and very loud and unruly. I have told him several times that they’re just untrained so they don’t know any better and the solution to the problem is to train them. I was under the impression that as soon as they get trained, he will allow them to sleep inside, but it’s not looking that way. I asked him if he has looked into training them and he says he just wants to find a specific trainer who will prepare them for hunting. 
I told him they will get nowhere hunting without first learning basic obedience so it doesn’t matter. 
I just want these beautiful dogs to have a fulfilling, comfortable, and happy life. And I don’t think he realizes that the dogs being with him more (even just laying at his feet while watching TV in the evening) will build a bond and end up making him happier too. I just think that he has never had the opportunity to bond with a dog closely so he will never understand my point of view until he does. 
It’s just so sad to see them yelp and jump and whine for attention all the time. I hate that they are stuck in a tiny space and don’t even have a dog house. And it makes me so upset that he says “they’re fine” because they deserve so much better than “fine”. Seeing them bark and jump in their tiny space makes me cry every time.

And this is not even mentioning the ignorance of him putting these two siblings (M+F) together in the same enclosure for 9 straight months. I’m worried about littermate syndrome and possible inbreeding occurring. 

Is it wrong of me to try to convince him to make them indoor dogs? If not, how do I do it? I don’t want to guilt trip him all the time but I don’t know how to emphasize how important it is to me, especially as the temperature starts dropping. It’s so unfair to those wonderful dogs and it’s upsetting that he is unfazed by it. 

Advice?

1668722823,self.DogAdvice,True,"Mochi, my 2-year-old Cavalier, sweet as the dickens and mostly smart to boot, can't seem to understand that outside is the only place he should go to the bathroom. We take him out regularly, almost too often by comparison to the tens of dogs I've had prior (and I know they are all different). We even got him mostly button trained so that he'll press a button (one in our living space, another in our bedroom) when he wants to go outside. But, at least once a day now, he'll just decide to go inside instead. The time is random, as is the accident and place he goes.  


He's fixed. And even when he does go inside, it's not in the same spot, and (if it's pee) it's never with a raised leg as if to mark. We always clean it with an enzyme cleaner, and a fancy carpet-washing vacuum to be sure that it's thorough. As I said, it's at least once a day, but never at the same time. I get up at 5 AM Monday thru Friday to walk him, and most mornings it's dragging him out of bed just to get up (it's cold and he's a snuggly lazy boy who likes to stay next to us under the weighted blanket, lol). He goes and does his business and then back to bed while I get ready for work. My partner gets up around 8 AM, and sometimes finds that Mochi has gone again, not even a full 3 hours later! If it's a good morning though, we can almost be assured there's going to be a different time that day he decides to have his accident. My partner stays up nightly, between 1 to 2 AM almost every weekday, just to make sure he goes outside before bed!  


During the day, if Mochi has to go, he'll press the button. My partner works from home, so Mochi gets to go out regularly on a short schedule just to try and keep ahead of the accidents as best we can. This basically has lined up to be 5 AM, 8 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM, 10 PM, and 1 AM. We had discovered back when things were really bad with his accidents, Mochi wasn't getting put in his kennel (we call it his home when speaking to him) enough for nap times. When we started that, it helped immensely, but not completely. We feed him regularly, twice a day, with the same amount of recommended food in the morning between 8 and 10 AM (depending on if we slept in on the weekend), and then again around 6 PM (depending on when we've had dinner, as he knows to go into his home while we eat, and his dinner is right after). He has constant access to clean, running water from a tip-proof cat water fountain. He likes it because his ""sister"" (our black cat) likes it, and they're the best of friends.  


And honestly, the craziest thing is, he'll have a day of the week (sometimes a weekday, sometimes a weekend, but not typically more than 2 times a week) where he not only doesn't have an accident, but he won't even ask to go outside for what most deem a normal amount of time between his restroom breaks, 8 hours! And he'll have those days without anything else being different - his meals, his naps, play times with either us or his sister, etc. But no matter what we do, we literally cannot come up with what we can do to replicate those days.  


We've taken him to our vet, who has done x-rays and scans to see if his bladder is ""small"" or if there's any infection(s), but he's in perfect health, and even more so considering his breed! We've been told over and over since he was a puppy (idc what people say, he still is, okay!!) ""Don't worry, it'll pass, and he'll be trained before you know it,"" or ""Just keep at it, and he'll get it,"" or ""have you tried to reward him with treats while outside and after he goes potty,"" or ""make sure you take him out consistently/at the same time,"" and more.

1668722578,self.DogAdvice,True,"I recently adopted a puppy and although I have had dogs my entire life I have never rescued one younger than 1. She is 11 weeks old and I haven’t been giving her any human food as she has had diarrhea, this is abnormal for me as my mom always gave our dogs little bits of human food and it never was an issue. 

I was eating some McDonald’s fries and since my other dogs love them I decided to give her a piece of one. It’s been about 30 minutes to an hour and she started gagging. It scared me because it sounded like an asthma attack and I thought she was choking or suffocating and she was laying in my arms asleep so it was really weird. She regurgitated the French fry and a few pieces of kibble. Anyone have puppy advice on what puppies can’t digest? 

I wanted to be strictly against giving into her begging but I just rescued her Saturday and French fries are my favorite so I thought she’d love to taste one for the first time too. Now I feel stupid and like a bad pet mom but I am new to puppies… I probably will stick to her dog treats from now on, I’m just curious.",DogAdvice,Puppy Help,
1668722265,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 5 year old Australian Cattle Dog mix boy and a 9 month old Poodle mix girl.

When my girl was younger and not potty trained, she was exclusively in a playpen in the kitchen. Gave her alone time everyday and it went okay. She wasn’t totally comfortable, but didn’t bark, cry, act upset etc. She basically just stared at the door.

After she got spayed around 6 months, and is now potty trained, I fully puppy proofed my bedroom and moved her in there. Not in the playpen, just stuck a baby gate at the door and let her free roam. Here’s the kicker, she has barrier frustration and is destroying the gate at the door. I try to give her alone time, but the barking and chewing commences as soon as I walk away. I leave her with toys and chews, but it’s not enough to engage her. 

I have a CTC, CPDT-KA, SAPro trainer, but it’s been little help. She says the two dogs play well together, but will never be able to be alone together because of their size differences (he’s about 70 pounds, she’s about 12 pounds). She recommends giving them 10-15 minutes a day supervised together without toys and then increasing the time. Which, cool but if she has barrier frustration and needs to be separated when I’m away, how do I do that? Now that she’s had freedom, she doesn’t care for her pen or crate anymore. Do I re-train her to go in her crate or playpen? Would half a day doggy daycare once a week help her be separated from me? Am I just a moron?! She can’t just free roam around my place because she steals his toys, steals whatever she can find, and just has no chill still. 

Sorry for my rambling, I’m just so frustrated and with US holidays coming up, and her not being able to be alone at all anymore I don’t know what to do.

1668717742,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi all! So, we have 3 dogs and a cat, and they really haven't had to be alone for much time at all, aside from a couple hours to go to the movies or something. I work from home, and on weekends we take them \*everywhere\* we can (except for Kitty, because he hates traveling, so we try to limit needing to take him places).

So anyway, we have a Friendsgiving an hour away, and we haven't seen any of these friends since we moved this January, so I'm not sure how long we will be there, and it was really starting to stress me out thinking about leaving them for 4-5+ hours (especially our littlest, who is 12 lbs who has a tiny bladder and is super super attached to me), so I asked my younger sister (she's 21 and a senior at the university in town here - SUCH a good kid) if she'd be able to hang out at our house and hang out with them, let them out to potty, etc. I told her she could do whatever she wanted, sleep, study, netflix, etc, essentially just make herself at home. She agreed and said she's really excited to see them and spend time with them and I'm SO grateful for it. 

My big question is, how much would you pay for a pet/house sitter for 5-7 hours? Money is really tight for me right now, but I want to be sure to pay her fairly. Not only because I truly appreciate her help (especially on a Saturday when she probably definitely has offers to get turnt with her college friends), but also because I feel like as her older sister I feel like it's important to set a precedent in place to where she's expected to be paid fairly for her work. She and I have a lot of similarities and she's SUCH a sweetheart, but I spent a good amount of my 20s being essentially a doormat/happiness pump/people pleaser, and if I can help to set a different precedent for her, I'd really like to.

Firstly I'll explain the weather in my area so it's easier to understand my concerns, here in Silesia we usually have no snow up until like mid December or even January, but it is very rainy and windy, and when the snow does appear it's VERY common to put salt/sand on the roads and sidewalks (it's also said that it's gonna be snowing a lot this year but they usually straight up lie so idk yet we'll see). 

Now as for my dog- she's 4 yo, weights 10.6 kg and is double coated.

Now as for the questions, first being- Do I buy her doggy shoes??? She already has some depigmentations going on on her paw pads because it's very cold (during the night it's below 0°C) and I don't know if it hurts her or is annoying? I've read the paw pads will get very dry during winter but nothing some beanie moisturizer can't fix but I'm not sure, there's also the topic of salt on ice which I know is painful for dogs to walk on.

Now the second question HOW DO I KNOW IF SHES COLD- I know! I know she's double coated and she's most likely NOT cold, but now that she's shedding, her coat is very thin and she's always very cold to touch after our walks so I thought maybe she's cold because of all that balding situation?

I wasn’t sure whether to post this on here or somewhere else, but i figured this place was as good as any.

Onto the main reason for my post, i’m a minor (not going to say exact age) and i have three dogs. I’ve owned all of them since i was in elementary school, and i’ve been expected to care for them all on my own. This includes feeding, walking, cleaning, grooming, etc. And while my parents did help me sometimes, i’ve mostly been on my own. Due to this, my dogs have become very matted over the years. I’ve always managed to just shave off the mats myself, luckily without hurting them, but it takes a very long time, multiple days on some occasions. Recently one of my dogs has developed some really thick matts on all four of her legs, they’re so close to her skin that i’m too scared to try to cut them off. I tried asking my mom if i could take then to get shaved at a groomers, but she said that they’ll take my dog away if they find out she’s matted, and i really don’t want that. 

Will the groomers actually take her away? She’s not badly neglected, she’s clean and flea free, she just has some really bad matts on her legs. I have a job, so i can pay for a sedated groom if needed, i just don’t want my dog to be in pain anymore. 

I know that this is my fault, i haven’t been brushing her like i should have, there’s just so much going on in my life atm, so i keep putting off brushing her, but now it’s too late

He slowly started getting energy because when he arrived he would lay under my moms car and not move no matter what . I had splash water on him for him to move so we could use the car. He was the nicest dog I’ve met even more so than my own dog and seemed to not need much except food . Well a couple came to pick him up cause they liked how calm he was and he is a beautiful dog  a German Shepherd. I have anxiety so I don’t work regular 5 day work week . I do odd jobs every now and then , I had 300 dollars I was saving up because I need a tooth pulled cause I have a cavity . Anyways I ended up wasting all my money on flea treatments for him and my yard because me and my neighbors got infested with fleas because he would lay under my house , it was really bad but o didn’t mind because I just wanted him to be healthy and clean so the couple would have no reason to not want him or put him out on the streets again. It was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders cause I really can’t handle responsibility or worries .

Im going off topic . 3 weeks ago my mom said the couple loved him and he was free in their fenced In yard. Being well taken care off I was so happy . Now unfortunately I found out today that he began to get aggressive. He ripped the neighbors cat to shreds apparently and they tried tying him up after that because when they would leave he would escape and try going with them , follow the woman everywhere. He didn’t want to be tied up though , would apparently pull very hard on his leash and trash around which I think is kind of normal if he hasn’t ever been tied up . But when they took him I put him on a leash and he was calm with them just stood or sat next to us. Apparently he ended up biting one of their children !

1668643888,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi everybody, so recently we adopted 2 dogs, a mom and son, they're pretty friendly towards people and relaxed overall. We are still adapting to the change since we only had a dog previously which was smaller although more aggressive.

The thing is these 2 are on the bigger side, the mom is like a mix of golden/lab and the son it's a husky mix. It's already quite the exercise going on a walk since they go crazy, they do relax and walk slowly after a bit but whenever a dog shows up, no matter what dog, the mom starts barking and does sound more aggressive, the son seems more playful because he even cries like if he wants to play. We don't let them of the leash since we don't know them yet and don't know if they could run away or cross the street, etc.

The problem is that sometimes I have to take them for a walk by myself and when they pull barking at another dog, between the 2 of them they do give me trouble holding them, once I already slipped and lost the leash of the son while in the middle of the street.

I have a senior dog who went completely blind very abruptly a few days ago. The vet diagnosed her with glaucoma and she is receiving treatment, but it seems as though the blindness is going to be permanent. 

Which brings me to the question: how can I safely prevent my dog from jumping onto my bed?

My bed is very high - I am an average height woman and the top of it is at hip-level for me. She has never had trouble jumping up, even after going blind - but getting down has been trickier. She is afraid to jump because she can't see the floor (and it's a long way down to be jumping blind) but she also panics if I try to pick her up to put her on the floor. While this is what I've been doing, it is stressful for her and she has snapped at me more than once - so I think it is in both of our best interest to not continue doing that. 

While she has also made the jump down a few times, I'm worried about the possibility that she'll hurt herself - either from the actual jump, or from hitting any of the nearby furniture. 

I've tried giving her a step - a solid piece of furniture to hop onto between the bed and floor - but even if I picked her up and put her on it, she wouldn't go from there to the bed and I also couldn't coax her from the bed onto the step. 

My bedroom unfortunately doesn't have a surplus of free space, so I don't have any room for a ramp that would be large enough for her - and I don't believe that she'd be inclined to use one.

I feel like the safest solution long-term would be to prevent her from getting onto the bed at all - she'll be sad, I'll be sad, but I won't have to worry about her breaking her neck jumping down into a bookshelf. She does have a pet bed right next to mine that she uses sometimes already, and I'm hoping to make that her permanent sleep spot. 

I've mostly been looking at things like toddler rails, but as this is my first experience with a blind dog and I've never actually used these sorts of rails before, I don't know if they'd be sufficient to stop a 40 pound dog from just barreling through or around them. Has anyone here tried this approach before, or are there better solutions?

She's a very stubborn dog, so unfortunately I don't think I could trust training alone for her (Chow mix) - and while she has a crate, it is in a different room and I don't think she'd like being confined to it at night. It is unfortunately too large to have in my bedroom with the space I have available, and she likes to be where I am.",DogAdvice,Advice for keeping a dog permanently off the bed?,

1668621698,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hi,
So my male dog(beagle) who is just less than 3 years old was diagnosed with a UTI yesterday(after we spotted pink stains in his pee) and was prescribed antibiotics(cefquinome and marbofloxacin). I gave the first dose of those to him today. 
It’s night here right now and he’s been shaking nonstop since last 1hr. 
I think the shaking/shivering is originating from around his hind legs.

He’s lying down, but the shaking is not stopping. 

Is there anyway I can help him get through the night, before I visit the vet again tomorrow first thing in the morning? 
Or do I need to get him to the hospital right now under emergency services?

1668621659,self.DogAdvice,True,"Looking for advice on how to curb crying/whining and neediness in a dog.

Bit of dog background: he's a giant breed mix, I rescued him when he was 1. Horribly behaved then, unsocialised and untrained. He's now 4. Has come on in leaps and bounds, is crate trained, semi-social with other dogs and lead/house trained etc. Doing so well! He's mostly stopped jumping when people come into the house- he absolutely adores all people. 

Bit of situation background: He's always been quite needy, since I got him. It took ages for him to stop crying/destroying things when I left the house. We're down to about 2 or 3 barks and a bit of crying before he settles now (have checked cams). But I got him when I was single, and now I'm seeing someone quite seriously. We're spending time between both houses. 

Now, the dog absolutely adores my boyfriend, and the Ukrainian couple he's hosting at his house. But that's now 4 people to contend with, all with different schedules. When I'm not there during the day, they sometimes want him out of the way (when cooking etc  as he's counter height). They'll sometimes have him in a different room with his bed. 

The issue: he seems to be crying and whimpering nonstop when he's not with people, and being a big dog he produces very loud crying! I've told them to ignore it and not give him attention, but any other solutions anyone can give, or tips?

Obviously since he’s a baby it has not been easy, my problem is that I live in a apartment with a roommate (I am planning on moving out soon so I don’t want my pup to get attached to them that much) and since it hasn’t been long since he got separated from his siblings and mom he hasn’t experienced being alone, and I am guilty of being with him almost 24h everyday since I got him…

When I say crate train I mean he’s very good about his crate he has had it and the bed in it since he was a puppy, and the only time he has ever had an accident in his crate is when we switched his dog food from puppy food to adult dog food and he had some tummy trouble. But it was thoroughly cleaned and that was months ago. 

He goes in there whenever we need to leave the house, so some days he’s in there for as much as five hours but that’s pretty rare, most of the time it’s for around two or three hour. He is very used to this routine and goes into the crate very willingly usually he immediately lays down to take a nap. 

But in the last week he has ripped up the bed in his crate and then today he destroyed the plastic crate mat. In both instances he wasn’t even in the crate for that long under four hours for both. 

I’m not sure what to do about it besides get a new crate mat, I don’t really want to spray the mat with the sour spray that we use for other things we want him to leave alone because I worry that it could hurt his nose being stuck so close to it.

I slammed on my breaks and turned around but, by the time I got there there was no sign of him. It left a weird feeling in my stomach and I’ve decided to do more digging. I found out some of the names of the people who there and found a couple social media pages - looking to see if they posted a picture w him. I found one graining video that one of the women posted and briefly a dog who looks exactly like my lost dog pans into the video. I believe he is with them but I have no idea how to prove.

My dog was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with pancreatitis. Initially he had liquid diarrhea on Friday night before vet visit on Monday and it stayed consistent and didn’t get better over the weekend. 

On the Monday he was diagnosed and given a drug (Cerenia) at the vet. I started him on Metronidazole for 7 days and FortiFlora for 10 days. All while on a bland diet. 

I had his 2 week check up and at the vet his blood panel still showed abnormal. Their machine only shows normal or abnormal. So we continued on with the bland diet for another week. X-Ray was negative on anything noticeable. 

Yesterday (week 3) his blood work still showed abnormal but I had them also send his blood out to get a number that could possibly show the severity of it, currently waiting for those results. 

His diarrhea stopped after the cerenia shot though it was still soft and messy just not liquidated.  He doesn’t throw up and seems more active and back to himself over time. The last week or so his poop is decently firm and looks normal.

She gets jealous when my boyfriend and I give each other affection. Either she’ll squeeze her way between us, nudge us until we either tell her to go on her pad or kennel or try to get in on the action with puppy kisses (which is not what you want to listen to or think about as you kiss your partner). She’ll even bark at us when we hug sometimes. We’re working on fixing these problems but progress is slow and I’m not exactly sure how to stop this behavior besides having her go to her pad and only giving her attention when I decide, not when she’s trying to get my attention. 

My boyfriends mom got a puppy recently and she HATES this poor creature.

1668534454,self.DogAdvice,True,"Just brought home a 1-year-old Border Collie mix who recently gave birth and was spayed. She loves people and (most) other dogs. There's one habit we're trying to work on - she jumps up as a greeting.

We're going to engage a trainer shortly but would love to hear anything that worked with your pup. She's about 50 lbs so her jumping could at some point hurt someone (though I don't think she means to). She's REALLY high-energy (which can be a little scary in and of itself). If she jumps on me while I'm standing I'll just calmly walk away and do something else. If she does it while I'm sitting, I can push her off (gently) but I have to keep petting her or she tries it again. She's very demanding about affection, which is sweet ... at first. But I can't type at the computer or look at my phone as she aggressively nudges my arm to pet her again.

I'm torn between wanting to give her lots of pats and attention (because of all she's been through, to reassure her) and thinking I'm maybe encouraging some of her behavior.

I suspect when we start working a trainer and come up with some training ""games"" she'll have a place to put some of that energy. She gets multiple walks during the day (some a mile or so) and we'll be taking her to a local dog run to get some of that energy out as well.

Where I live there are only three veterinarians within a two hour drive and they’re all booked out for at least two weeks. Am I just supposed to wait two weeks and hope she gets better on her own in the meantime. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want her to be in pain for weeks until she can be seen.

1668529071,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog is a whole mix of breeds (Staffordshire pit, tree walking coonhound, and lab are the main ones). He’s about 1.5 years old and has always been a very good eater. So much so that when he was a pup we used a slow feeder. 

Recently, he had this mass on his foot that got very red and infected. We took him to the vet and they gave us antibiotics and anti inflammatory pills. He hates the pills (they smell like a fart) and we’ve been shoving them down his throat for about a month now after every meal. The mass on his foot is almost gone (just some scabbing/scar tissue left), but for the last couple of days he’s been completely uninterested in his breakfast or dinner. He still takes treats and snacks but just licks all the kibble in his bowl during meals. I have to hand feed him the food because he has to take the pills with food in his stomach. 

So I’m wondering if the reason my dog isn’t eating is because he’s now associated meal time with getting 3 pills shoved down his throat. The pills run out tomorrow morning and the vet doesn’t want to see him unless the bump on his paw comes back. Should I just wait and see if his behavior changes after the pills stop or is this something I should address sooner rather than later?",DogAdvice,Concerned over my dog not wanting to eat…,

For the sake of brevity I’ll leave all the details out but happy to provide any that may be helpful. But every few month we were having episodes of gastroenteritis that would land him at the emergency vet. A recent episode evolved into HGE and then this most recent one just started as HGE

I understand they cause isn’t really known but the vet said with as often as these episodes are happening there has to be some underlying condition. We did all the blood panels - all came back in acceptable ranges. We are now trying a strict diet. Essentially just hydrolized protein food. No treats at all. I have no way to know if it’s working. If he has another episode in a couple of months it’s not. Otherwise it may be. The only other test she has mentioned is a ultrasound to check the thickness of intestinal lining.

She was fine for a while until a few months ago when she started bleeding again.  We had X-rays and a urinalysis done, but there were neither crystals nor bacteria found.  The vet put her on a round of a general antibiotic -  Clavamox - and everything seemed fine.

my father didn’t want to go to the vet because he knew how expensive it would be. we went to the vet in 2020 and they told us they would have to do major surgery to his anal region, and there was major chance with rudy’s age at the time already that rudy would lose complete function of his anus and bowel movements. also a nervousness about sending rudy through a major surgery with his heart murmur and his age. this surgery would cost $7,000. my dad refused, and cried on the way home

my dad has a habit of empathizing with rudy, saying “his ass must hurt” and “poor guy”. when i say that we could do something about it, such as start looking around for other vets and second and third opinions- he refuses, saying it will be a waste. it is my impression that he has given up on rudy’s chance of a better life.

Mom has done alright with the litter, does't like them as we thought she would (she's been VERY maternal towards human babies). For context, she's a very gentle and patient alpha, and has done very well with other's puppies. When she's needed to set boundaries she does a great job at communicating with other dogs and the puppies before doing anything physical like nipping. 

Our puppies play hard, sometimes I'm concerned a little too aggressively, and recently Mom has started nibbling on her puppies when they're playing. She's done it for a bit outside of them playing, nibbling on their chest or neck (cobbing I guess its called). Recently, however, she has started doing it while they're playing, and started biting (gently) at one of their back legs. What causes me concern is that its always on whichever dog is being picked on. Since theres three pups, two can gang up on another, but this actually happens less frequently than one of the pups just bullying one of the others. Mom was raised with one of her littermates for about 2.5 years, and when she played with him she would always ""win"" by yanking the back leg out from under her brother, so we have seen this behavior from her before except she doesn't do it as extremely with the puppies.

The times where I have seen Mom join in have been both when they seem to be playing at what I deem an appropriate level of ""aggressive"" and when they've been ""too aggressive."" She will nibble on them and sometimes bite a back leg, but always on the pup thats being bullied.   


Should I be concerned? She has never hurt another dog in her life, but it concerns me that she's doing it on the pup who is being bullied. I'm trying to determine if the pups are being truly ""too aggressive"" and if so I plan to separate them when they are. They all have their own crates. Not sure when to have the pups stopped and not sure if mom is playing healthily or being a bully.

He’s just old and a little grumpy and my 2.5 year old is a human tornado.  He also bit my wife recently.

All in all he isn’t aggressive just extremely playful.

My grandparents came to visit us and are staying for a month, but my dog just doesn’t seem to like em. Since the second they entered our house till now (2 whole days) he barks at their every move and even if he hears any noise made by them whether it is talking or sneezing or burping. 

This is very surprising cause he has never done this to anyone before, not even the guests he has never seen before. 

My mom and I think he may have sensed our hatred to our grandparents and is reacting the same way (yeah, my mom and I hate my dads parents cause they think they are more superior than us and tend to degrade my mom a lot).

Is there a way to get him more comfortable with them?
We have tried taking him for a walk with them,  made my grandparents ignore him, consoled him that we are fine and also given him the firm commands to listen which he usually listens to but not this time.

What do I do to get him to calm down and be normal again?

I have a 2 year old Bichon who is *very* excitable and darts around when having fun. She isn't aggressive, more so timid until she is comfortable with you. 

She has been extremely tolerant of my 2 month old pup, which seems to be instinctual. So it isn't my Bichon I'm worried about bringing harm. 


Golden goes for the eyes, man. She is nothing by teeth and will nip every near her mouth. Anytime we tried to let them play, she just wants to bite Bichon. 

I *can* tell when either of them want to stop play or need space.. so it isn't that Golden is upset. This is just how she plays, as I assume puppies this age do. 

Bichon doesn't react with biting of tail or paws usually but she does get hurt and squeak, which is when I usually have to stop play. 


Also, I'm not sure if my Bichon knows how to correct the Golden? I don't know if that's really a thing dogs do at these ages.. I see her put her head over Golden and sometimes boop her with paw or snoot after being bitten. But other than that, I'm too scared of Golden taking an eye to let Bichon figure things out with her. 


Some online trainers say to just keep them separated until Golden is more matured. Other say that it's important to let them do this. 

But dude those teeth fucking her and Golden has just been really trying to get my Bichon's eyes.

1668350665,self.DogAdvice,True,"Our golden doodle Snoopy is 1y3m and has started more regularly leaving drops of poo after we pen him into the basement or behind a baby gate. 

A bit of backstory, we adopted him when he turned 1 in August, as his current parents were expecting at the time and couldn't sufficiently take care of him. He was completely matted, and suffered from anxiety being stuck at home in a mud room while both parents worked all day.

He has improved a lot and is doing well in our new dog training class! Still is very anxious about meeting new people but he is so full of love and joy with people he knows.

We tend to spend weekends at our parents house in the basement, which Snoopy loves as there are so many windows to see squirrels out of. Lately though, if we happen to need to leave him at home at our parents house (which he loves, it's a bit larger than our own), he will poop within 15 minutes of us penning him into the basement. I've tried going on walks for 15-30 minutes outside with him and he does seem to relieve himself completely right before we leave... He still has consistently left a pile right after we leave. 

I've heard some people say this might be ""revenge poo"" for leaving him alone and not taking him with us. He loves knowing where everyone is at and will routinely patrol the house and check all the windows when we're chilling at home. I can only think it has to do with anxiety, which I feel horrible about because especially for church there's nobody to stay home with him. Thankfully my wife works remotely and loves having him around, but for the times when we are both gone I can't imagine how hard it is for him.

Not really sure what to do at this point... Maybe we need to walk him for longer before leaving? Maybe he needs a smaller space to feel better? He's about 70 pounds so i don't want him to feel cramped either. Any thoughts would be appreciated, specially if I'm doing something wrong.

I have a dog who’s 10months. We aren’t sure what she is but we think shes a jack russle America bulldog mix. She’s very active and an amazing cuddle buddy. We love her but she is not the true reason I am posting. 

Today my partner and I were looking up  the trainer my parents recommend to us. We last minute needed a place to have her stay as we scored concert tickets. 

My parents swear by this guy and I have had a few training session with him and my dog and they were amazing. He clearly knows what he’s doing. His level of knowledge and experience is astounding. He’s trained both my parents German Shepard’s. My little 20lb dog seems like a cake walk for this trainer. 

Now here’s the problem: 

Today we searched his name in our city and right under his dog training website we saw a very concerning article. It detailed that a young teenager was mauled by four dogs that were this trainers dogs. He was paying this young man to feed and check on the dogs and was found mauled to death while the trainer was out of the country. It was clearly stated that our trainer gave up all his rights and was nothing but helpful in the investigation. The four dogs were euthanized.

It just has me really baffled because... Is it really that rewarding for her? I don't understand what in her head makes her want them so bad, it's just water after all. Tonight, she was upstairs with another member of the house, and I was making a drink with ice. I got the tray out, and as soon as I did that, she BOLTED downstairs, like straight up running. But if I were to let's say open the treat drawer, she probably wouldn't come running unless I shook the bag and shouted her name.

I also want to ask if this is okay to humor or if I should nip it in the bud? I don't know if they're good for her teeth or not. She is a very chewing dog, tears through chew toys really fast, chews through some household things. Not as bad as when she was a little puppy but she definetely enjoys it. I feel like she chews less after being given an icecube but I could totally be placeboing myself there. As of the moment she gets one icecube a day at the max. On average I'd say every couple of days, since y'know, don't need ice as much in the winter. Is this okay to entertain? Is there any reason she might be so attached to them? Am I overthinking a dog just being a weird dog? I'd appreciate any advice, thank you and have a nice day :)",DogAdvice,Corgi obsessed with icecubes??? Is this normal?,

2 year old basenji 
6 year old small hound mix
And 13year old elderly bully

The hound and bully have been living together for the last 5 years or so. The bully is dog selective but has gotten along very well with the hound and basenji. She is significantly bigger than the other 2 dogs. The basenji and hound are nearly the same size - slightly different but similar. 

Anyway, whenever the basenji and bully play or start getting riled up (play) the hound mix will immediately run up to the bully and growl on her and almost attack her - this has actually led to one fight between the bully and hound. The hound mix will ALSO bark aggressively (but not attacking) the basenji who then runs away doing zoomies. 

But basically the hound mix will ALWAYS intervene whenever my basenji and bully play! I do keep the hound mix away from the other 2 dogs because her behavior is not reliable or safe especially after that one fight. 

But I have no clue why she reacts that way. Her hair is raised and she immediately goes directly up to the bully and growls in her face (anyway the bully is deaf but it’s not like my other dogs know that).

Does anyone have any explanations on **why** this is happening? So far I’m working on subthreshold desensitizing training with the hound mix slowly and also removing her from the area if necessary as to not trigger her further. I just don’t know **why**?!

1668263210,self.DogAdvice,True,"My wife and I got a 3 y/o male beagle from a rescue back in June and he hates me. He always has. He was super nervous the first few weeks we had him, but we assumed this was just because he was settling in. A month goes by and he fully settles in with my wife. When I'm at work, he plays with her, lays with her, follows her, and even learns how to sit. Every day I come home it's the same old story. He howls when he hears my car pull up, he barks when I come through the door, he poops and pees wherever he is standing when I walk into the living room, and then he runs and hides in his crate.

We then assumed he may have been abused by a man, after all, he was a hunting dog and given up because ""he wasn't good at hunting."" However, my wife and I went on vacation for a week and during this time, we left him with a petsitter. I warned the petsitter that he might have some really bad anxiety when her husband was home to the point that me might bark and defecate himself. To my relief, she said this was no problem. However, during our trip the sitter sent me several pictures and videos of our dog sitting in her husband's lap, kissing him, and playing with him. It was very sweet, but it also broke my heart.

1668225334,self.DogAdvice,True," I adopted an 2 month old golden retriever last weekend and she will be 3 months tomorrow. 

My first dog, who is now 2, was admittedly neglected in training and it took a while for us to potty train her. But it was ""easier"" when she was a puppy because I just ignored her and let her do what she wanted, while sleeping with us. 


I learned my lesson and want to do things right (while also training my 2 yr old). Which right now means not a single drop of pee on the carpet and she *will* be crate trained.

But for fuck sake I haven't slept more than maybe 3 hours a night since I got her. Some nights I just don't fucking sleep at all.

She is sleeping in bed with us, which I can already hear you all screaming. But it was advised by a YT trainer and her breeder to have her sleep with us at first to help ease her transition.

The thought is that she is still too young to really be trained or get what I'm trying to do and right now I need to focus on building her confidence and security. 

However, I think this is contributing to me losing sleep. Because it would be one thing if I just had to get up ever 2 or 3 hours for 10 minutes then go right back to bed. But she wakes up, bites me and fucks around, I bring her back to bed, then she bites and and fucks around for like fucking 15 minutes! Then I just can't sleep. 



I am crate training in the day time, she is at the point where she will voluntarily go into her crate for space sometimes. She will stay there when I put her in during a nap but she has to already be asleep. Today I tried putting her in as she was falling asleep and closing the door. She didn't like that, of course. 


So that's what I'm doing about crate training, in hopes that she will soon just sleep in there at night and that will solve the Potty Play Time issue. 

One thing that is giving me comfort is that she seems very smart and is extremely food motivated so training isn't that difficult... her recall is pretty perfect already, and I don't even need to use food anymore. 

So think the only obstacle with crate training or stuff that requires some separation from me is that she is just *so* attached to me. I can't leave the room without her losing her shit. 



Anyway, is it typical and expected to be sleep deprived when they're this young? I feel like I've never seen anyone mention it.

I'm sure this is a crating issue but whatever advice you got, lay it on me. I could really use the encouragement too.

1668222639,self.DogAdvice,True,"I recently moved in with my boyfriend and we both have dogs. I have a big catahoula (f) and he has a little pomeranian (m). My dog has never really liked going into bathrooms once she learned that's where baths happen and she hates baths. But recently I've been catching her trying to get into the bathroom from time to time.

Why is this a problem? Because the bathroom is where my boyfriend's dog's stuff is. His bed, his toys, his water, and his food.

My dog gets fed 2 times a day and she eats all of her food within a few minutes. She loves food. Actually the only thing so far I know she *won't* eat is lettuce. My boyfriend's dog, however, has his bowl filled and we just fill it again once it's all gone. He seems to only want to eat when people are in the bathroom with him.

The food he had before started running out, and my boyfriend wasn't sure what food he's been eating (I think someone else bought the food for him) so we've started switching him to new food. It just so happens that the new food is the same brand as my dog's food. And I think my dog has been trying to get into the bathroom since we started giving his dog the new food. We're wondering if she smells something familiar and is trying to get to it because of that.

After getting home today from driving my boyfriend to work, I noticed his dog's food was entirely gone. Which would be impossible knowing how he eats and that I had refilled the bowl just maybe 2 hours or so earlier. The bowl was also in a weird spot, pushed up against the wall and his water bowl as if it had been nudged there, like when my dog eats and her bowl shifts. And my dog was acting super guilty when I got home, so I know she did it.

That's long winded, sorry. But basically I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to get my dog to leave his food alone. I don't want her over eating or eating food made for small breeds since she definitely is not one. The only thing I can think of right now is to set up a crate and put his food in the crate. Maybe the opening would be too small for her head and she wouldn't be able to get to it. Right now, I'm just having to keep the bathroom door closed unless we (my boyfriend or I) are going in, since that's the only time his dog seems to eat anyway. But I hate keeping him from his toys and water and such.

1. When he's lying down her doesn't want people in his space. He doesn't mind me so much (who he is attached to) but he gives the kids a warning yelp when they linger too close to him (notably near his face).
2. He doesn't allow anyone to examine his feet. We believe this is associated with arthritis, but even if not it seems understandable.

The guidance we've given to the kids is, listen we know he has two clearly defined rules. Respect them, and we'll keep enjoying him. Disrespect them, and there will be no trust from him and the warning yelp could lead to a warning bite.

1668191598,self.DogAdvice,True,"Risks vs benefits. Spaying age/right time.

Small info blurb. Sweet girl is a German Shepherd, dalmation, great pyrenees mix. She's about 7.5 months old. The vet brought up getting her spayed and he wanted it done right away, like last month. I knew enough to know that larger breeds should wait. So, we started researching. I know that it's generally RECOMMENDED to wait until at least 2. However, we had decided to wait until after her first heat and go from there. We found that Mammory cancer was the big risk factor for waiting. Chances went up to like 8 percent waiting for first heat, increasing largely to 26 percent if we wait until after her second heat. So we HAD planned to get her spayed in the new year after her first heat after reading that large breeds typically go into heat their first time between 9-12 months. Well, 7 months and here's her first heat. Which if we were to get her spayed before her second heat, she would barely be a year old. And I'm iffy about that. 

So. Here's where I need help. IS Mammory cancer such a big risk that spaying based on heat cycles it worth it MORE than age? Or are the benefits of waiting until she's 2, out weight the risks of Mammory cancer? 

I know that it's so that the hormones can help her grow properly. That hip and bone problems become an issue when spayed earlier. But is that a reason to wait, when Mammory cancer is such a risk?

They get along perfectly when we’re relaxing and just all of us laying on the couch together.  When the bigger dog gets up to do something, the smaller dog doesnt do anything and continues napping. But when the small dog gets up to do something, even just slowly walking around the house, the bigger dog lunges towards them. Both of them immediately start growling and barking. The smaller dog is baring their teeth and the larger dog will usually try to like hug her or get on top of her. However both of their tails are also wagging. They also nip at eachother but theres been no serious injuries.

I always separate them though because my brothers dog is clearly bigger in size and is the one instigating by lunging and jumping on mine.

1668183360,self.DogAdvice,True,"I have a 1 year old lab mix my mom has two 2 year old dogs one is a kelpie mix the other she says is a kelpie mix but it looks like a pit bull mix with something else idk it's a big dog. Her dogs are very very spoiled and mine is as well but is also well trained. 

Well we have recently moved in together due to financial reasons. I did not move into her house we collectively combined into a new house. 

How can I keep my dog separate and continue the training when her dogs are wild?? 

Examples - 

We have a backyard so she just leaves the back door open and lets the dogs have free range of the house and yard. I do not like this my dog had structured routine there are times to rest and there are times to play. My dog is getting all confused and thinks that play time is now all the time and is getting anxious and has also run so much that all four of her toe beans are raw and bleed at times. 

Her dogs constantly come in the kitchen and jump up on the counters and lick the food off of the dishes in the sink and lick the countertops. And lick off people's plates at the dinner table. My dog knows or at least knew to stay out of the kitchen she does not anymore and is now trying to jump up on the counters even though I continue to correct her. All of her training there is now gone because she's just following the other two dogs. 

Her dogs constantly bark and growl and fight, I know that sometimes when dogs play they look vicious but these dogs are actually growling like they're fighting I can tell the difference. She lets it go on for too long and aside from being dangerous to the dogs it's extremely loud and distracting and my dog gets mixed up in it often. 

It was agreed before we moved in together that all of the dogs would be sleeping in our respective bedrooms but that has not happened and I believe is now not going to happen because of the size of her dogs kennels. She says they take up too much space in her room so she's going to just leave them in the main living room. I want to keep my dog separate but she knows that the other two dogs are out there and she constantly whines and cries and I cannot lock her in the other room because the two dogs are in the living room and she can hear them. So if we're out in the kitchen and need the dogs locked away my dog is now in the back barking because she knows the other two dogs are still in the kitchen/living area.


Those are the biggest issues right now I guess, my biggest thing is how do I not ruin my dogs training while we are in this living situation and how do I handle my dogs jealousy at her dogs? 

And how do I keep my dog listening to me??? My dog is obviously gravitating towards the person with less rules and more treats for doing nothing. Also my dog will sit in my room and lick her paws until the fur comes off because she can hear the other dogs playing outside constantly. I need advice!",DogAdvice,Advice for 3 dogs,

One of the pups (7F) has bone cancer, found out a couple days ago. He has been calling everywhere and got a date set to start the oncology work on the 15th. He’d like it sooner but that was after calling all oncology clinics in the state.

The thing is, it’s eating away at her leg bone and he can’t handle the stress of sitting around with that knowledge. After we get her in on the 15th we have to wait another week or so to set surgery and then another two weeks to start chemo. And he can’t function, knowing it could metastasize. There isn’t any way to get it fixed sooner. On top of all this, the vet says we will only have a few months to a year with her after all this. Not much chance of remission.

Its usually just me home since my mom works 2 jobs, i have a full time job as well and my boyfriend(M19) lives here working full time. She has 6 dogs, 3 queensland heelers, a pitbull, a labrador, and a german shepard. My boyfriend and I have one little chihuahua who sleeps and eats in a crate and is house trained after only having her for afew months. my mom keeps getting these dogs who are mostly working dogs and just throwing them in the yard essentially. She doesnt get them any toys or ever plays with them or walks them so they are just in the yard very antsy all the time. This leads them to be very destructive to our house and eachother. She lets them all sleep in the house and every day when theres poop all over the house it is my responsibility to pick it up or if they eat the food off the counter I have to clean up the mess. We have goats as well and the dogs (mostly GS) have killed/injured multiple of our goats to which my mom will not seek veterinary care or make me help her throw away a dead goat. My moms queensland heelers and the german shepard all bite and growl and are very dog aggressive. I have been bit by my moms heeler at least 3 times unprovoked. 2 of the heelers are both VERY aggressive if you try to put them outside, if you come near them or try to grab their collar while the slider is open they WILL bite you and even if you are at a spot you think they cant reach theyll still reach their stubby little head down to bite you. My moms german shepard barks constantly and i was able to convince her to buy a bark collar but she also bites very severely and is dog aggressive towards the pitbull mostly but all of the other dogs. If me and my boyfriend buy any toys for the dogs or anything the german shepard will not let the dogs play with them she will circle and bark at them until they react and she has a reason to bite/attack them. The pitbull and the GS get into it pretty often(the pitbull isnt fixed and the GS is dog aggressive) and usually they scuffle and it sorts itself out then theyll be fine but there has been afew occasions that they get really messed up. This started pretty severely when i was 16 and it was most of the time just me home after school when the GS and pit would start trying to kill each other. Multiple times i have had to have my friends/family come attempt to break up the dog fights. but anyways this leads us to now they are in one of their hating eachother fits but the GS really really messed up the pit and one of the heelers joined in and chewed the back of her legs practically raw. My mom will not seek veterinary care. I have tried to get my mom to train them, ive offered to split the cost of crates for all of them, and i dont know what much else i can do.

1668115815,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog is a sharpei/chow mix who is estimated to be about 10 or 11 years old right now. We adopted our boy in 2016 when he was about 5. 2016 to 2020 were great years. 2020 he got attacked by a loose dog. 2020 he also had his first vestibular episode (unrelated to the attack). 2021 another vestibular episode which took away his ability to jump on and off our bed. 2022 he had another episode and his balance is pretty wonky now. He developed bad anxiety (panting and pacing). After lots of vet visits and test treatments with anxiety medicine, it was determined that he likely has a brain lesion or tumor to explain his odd behavior and his hair trigger anxiety. :(

The medicine he is on now seems to help him act more “normal” but I’ve accepted that he’ll never be the 2016-2020 version of himself. Trazadone helps keep his anxiety at bay. He still has panting episodes though if there is any change in routine. Melatonin at night to help him sleep and an nsaid to help his arthritis because his back legs are stiff. 

Honestly, this last year it has been so stressful to own a dog. I would never ever re-home him and I’m definitely not wishing for anything to happen to him. I just feel trapped and my mental health has seriously plummeted. I want to cherish the years we have left but sometimes it’s hard when he gives me anxiety! 

Any slight change in routine and he gets super anxious. I’m not kidding, my husband and I literally have to “assume position” at the end of the night on the couch with him. If we don’t, he will pace and pant. For example, last weekend I laid down for a nap at 6:30 pm in my bed which was not normal for him. He paced the entire time I was trying to lay down in the bedroom because I wasn’t in the living room like “normal” when the evening came. 

My husband has to sleep on the couch with him at night and then sneak off to bed with me after he falls asleep. We have to plan out when to give him Trazadone if we decide to go out in the evening. If we stay home, it’s always 7:30 pm but we can’t always be home at that time. Our sex life revolves around if he is asleep or outside.

To top it off, all of these issues started at the beginning of this year which is also when I found out I’m pregnant. I’m currently weeks away from birth and he has ruined my mental health and made my pregnancy so stressful. I have to tip toe around his anxiety otherwise he pants and paces. He is in for a rude awakening when the baby is here because I can’t promise his routine will stay the same each and everyday. 

We tried Xanax and it gave him a HORRIBLE reaction that landed him in the ER. We tried natural remedies and that does nothing. 

My husband is less inclined to think it’s his time. He’s willing to wait til he’s on his last leg but the amount of times this dog has made me cry or given me a panic attack in the last year is insane. He will never be his old self again. Bringing our baby home soon is stressing me out all because of him. 

I know this may sound like there is no quality to his life but there is. He uses the bathroom no problem. He eats and drinks. He still loves going outside and going on walks, even though we can’t walk as long now. Our vet told us it will be time when he stops doing what he loves. 

I guess I’m just looking for similar stories and advice on how to cope with a stressful senior pet. It’s so challenging to feel trapped and feel guilty for feeling trapped. I’ve debated many times if euthanasia is the best option but it feels like murder since physically he is fine and when he’s happy, it’s great. I’ve never experienced this with a dog to the point that my mental health is affected and my home doesn’t feel peaceful unless it’s on his terms.",DogAdvice,My dog is ruining my mental health,
1668115723,self.DogAdvice,True,"My dog is a sharpei/chow mix who is estimated to be about 10 or 11 years old right now. We adopted our boy in 2016 when he was about 5. 2016 to 2020 were great years. 2020 he got attacked by a loose dog. 2020 he also had his first vestibular episode (unrelated to the attack). 2021 another vestibular episode which took away his ability to jump on and off our bed. 2022 he had another episode and his balance is pretty wonky now. He developed bad anxiety (panting and pacing). After lots of vet visits and test treatments with anxiety medicine, it was determined that he likely has a brain lesion or tumor to explain his odd behavior and his hair trigger anxiety. :(

The medicine he is on now seems to help him act more “normal” but I’ve accepted that he’ll never be the 2016-2020 version of himself. Trazadone helps keep his anxiety at bay. He still has panting episodes though if there is any change in routine. Melatonin at night to help him sleep and an nsaid to help his arthritis because his back legs are stiff. 

Honestly, this last year it has been so stressful to own a dog. I would never ever re-home him and I’m definitely not wishing for anything to happen to him. I just feel trapped and my mental health has seriously plummeted. I want to cherish the years we have left but sometimes it’s hard when he gives me anxiety! 

Any slight change in routine and he gets super anxious. I’m not kidding, my husband and I literally have to “assume position” at the end of the night on the couch with him. If we don’t, he will pace and pant. For example, last weekend I laid down for a nap at 6:30 pm in my bed which was not normal for him. He paced the entire time I was trying to lay down in the bedroom because I wasn’t in the living room like “normal” when the evening came.

Briggs is usually very cautious when approaching strangers, so when he finds someone, he usually stops short of them and stares at them. This is actually an improvement, because he used to softly growl at them (it was an unsure of them thing, not an intimidation thing). So to get him to stop growling at them, I would praise him for finding them (based on his behavior change), so now I need a definite ID from him, but I don’t know what to make him do. 
When there’s no scent for him to follow, he jumps on me. When he’s alerting on a door, he’ll sit at the door. 
I thought of having his ID be to sit and give me a ‘speak’, but it’s not ‘natural’ for him, and he doesn’t know that command yet. Additionally, I’m afraid if I’m finding an autistic child, then Briggs will scare the child with his bark.

-	Thunder shirts

-	Two different trainers, one in their own home. 
-	Daily exercise and/or dog park with our other dogs

I'm a diagnosed trauma tension ""sufferer"" who refuses anxiety meds because it's stupid that this dog's sharp bark results in anxiety. He just never stops. The neighbors are complaining, dog owners are complaining when he barks at their dogs' normal alerts, he barks the whole time we are gone from the house.

He's got to be miserable. His back is just tight muscles and no amount of anxiety supplements or herbs help. He's developed a heart murmur and he'll probably die of it, it's so serious. 

Horrible admission: I talked to spouse about letting him go when he starts seizures or passing out. I have developed a diagnosed heart problem myself because every time he barks unexpectedly I jump (has to do with the reason I have PTSD). But I just can't kill an anxious but healthy dog.

7 year old lab mix with propensity to eat things she should not (but always passes them)

55lbs, spayed. Takes 16mg apoquel daily. 

On Sunday, she was in her kennel and must have gnawed off part of her fleece blanket. We noticed this in her stool the next day. While she hasn't eaten this before, she's taken a stab at a kennel cover, a back pack, a passport, and various other inedibles over the years without issue. 

She's eating, drinking, and behaving normally. We don't see any fleece after Monday night. Stomach is soft, she doesn't seem to have any pain.

This morning, I wake up to find her pooping in our bed. Normal stool (not diarrhea) but unusual. I think it might be an anxiety poop since her schedule is off and we have been packing for a cross country move. She has pooped inside because of anxiety before. 

I take her to a 24 hour vet out of an abundance of caution, and because I'm nervous about any issues during move. 

they take x-rays, but overall she looks fine according to the vet. Says her belly is soft. We get sent home with antibiotics and a probiotic for any digestive upset. 

This evening, they call and say they sent the x-rays to a radiologist who identified something in her stomach that ""likely"" is the blanket. They recommend surgery or at least observation in their ICU, fasting, and rescan tomorrow. I ask if we can just fast her overnight and bring her back, vet doesn't like that plan. I ask if we can get her scans from this morning and talk to our normal vet tomorrow for a second opinion. She says she doesn't know if they can send the scans and the radiologist was a second opinion. Idk if she was frustrated but she seemed to really dislike that I asked.

I'm at a loss here, I have whiplash from the ""yeah she's fine"" to ""no she needs surgery."" Am I making a massive mistake by waiting to see her normal vet tomorrow? She has separation anxiety and I feel like an overnight is also overkill when she is behaving like her happy, normal self.

The complicating factor  were supposed to leave for our move on Friday. It's a three day trip, and we will be pretty far from emergency care Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon when we arrive.

My sister has a small chiweenie  that was a rescue from a hoarder situation, she's 9 years old now, we've had her little over a year.  She was clearly abused given by all the scars on her face, she used to bark and run away from everything but now its escalated to barking and charging at stuff to bite it- atleast for me and my dogs. 

A few months ago when I first asked for advice it happened after she bit me for the first time. Had to get stitches but I blame myself because I could've handled the situation better. Long story short sister left the house, dog somehow got foot stuck in spiral notebook, tried to help dog and she was letting me until I got pliers then- chomped.  She was scared amd hurt so really dont blame her.

After that I tried really  hard to get her to like me like she's super food motivated so I give her treats and bought her lickimatts and treat toys to help her destress.  For awhile it did seem like she was really coming around to me, like she would come up to me at the gate wagging her tail expecting a treat and isn't as upset when my sister isn't home. 

But she's suddenly made a U-turn to being mean again. My sister let her out of her room and she charged at me barking tried to grab my leg but thankfully just grabbed my pants legs. She's tried that a couple times now and my sister ignores me and tells me it's no big deal.

Now when I come over to the doggy gate at my sisters door she runs up to the gate barking, snarling, and trying to get at me through the gate. Literally yesterday I put a basket of clothing  by the gate and she grabbed a sweater sleeve through the gate and started biting the hell out of it. 

I don't know what to do honestly,  I've done what I can safely and my sister doesn't seem to care or see a big deal about the behavior. I've told her that she needs to start walking the dog or burn off some of that energy to help with stress and don't use negative reinforcement bc she's already afraid(ie spray bottle and yelling) at bare minimum. Neither suggestions have been used. 


I make sure to keep her separate from my dogs per adviced by the behaviorist, I'm pretty sure she'd start a fight with my dogs and that would likely end poorly since my dogs are 75 lbs and 50 lbs.

So the vet said it was probably not a uti. During this visit we also did a blood test but everything was normal except high bilirubin. 

Today we went back to the vet to do another blood test and it’s different doctor this time (but the same clinic) who is going over the last visit. He mentions something the other vet didn’t which is my dogs urine is highly acidic. A pH of 9 which could indicate a uti.

1668037804,self.DogAdvice,True,My male German Shepherd turned 2 this week so we bought him any toy he picked out at the store. He previously showed some protective behavior towards stuffed toys so we stayed away from them and pretty much stick to rubber toys. We've had him for a year now and he's completed his training classes but still showed some protective behavior toward stuffed plush toys (but none towards his bones and rubber toys or even food). Of course he picked a plush duck toy and still showed some protective behavior over it (growling and snipping that otherwise we never see). Well the toy lasted all of 2 days but I'm wondering if we should continue to avoid plush toys or if it would be beneficial to keep buying them to hopefully wean out the protective behavior with treat exchanges or something. He's a very sweet friendly guy and never shows aggression except when protecting his plush toys.,DogAdvice,Plush toy aggression,

1668026000,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I adore my dog. He's an ""American"" Corgi. I knew he was a corgi mix when I got him. But I didn't really know about the fashion breed until after. I have a full Pembroke. Anyway, I got him when he was about nine months old. So he wasn't a puppy. The story is that he was the last of a litter. No one wanted him because he wasn't real heavy with the red merle that they wanted. And he didn't get the blue eyes. So he was kind of cast aside. The breeder ended up moving and couldn't sell him so her mom took him. And she breeds American Bulldogs. My little guy was kept mostly in a kennel that was heated and cooled, according to the seller. She said he got plenty of time hanging out with the other dogs. But I have no clue what happened as far as training goes. She said he was in the process of potty training.

I've had him now for three years. I finished his training. So he does awesome on leashes. He's potty trained. Does really well with other dogs. And cats. Like amazing with cats. Good dog. Super smart. Learned really fast. BUT during the first year I noticed some odd behavior. One, he was scared of males at first. To the point when my boyfriend would pet him, he'd pee. Second, showing any kind of discipline would also make him pee. He'd flinch if he thought he was in trouble. He'd pee if we raised our voice. So of course I'm assuming he was abused.

A lot of the behavior we've corrected with patience and consistency. He started getting food aggressive but we've corrected that. He's still really bad about getting into the trash. But here's the thing... so let me first say he trained *himself* to go into the kennel. Like... he realized when we leave, we put him in the kennel. So when we put our shoes on, that's where he goes. I'm again assuming this is a save haven for him. So any time he thinks he's in trouble, he also puts himself in the kennel. It got to the point where now we don't really know how to punish him. Because now he growls at us when he gets in trouble. 

His body language is more like he's scared. We've NEVER hit him. We do not believe in physically correcting our dogs. Just... no. But he definitely backs himself into the kennel and growls when we get onto him. He's bitten me once. He got a pork chop the cat had knocked down. And I reached for it thinking I could grab it. Big mistake on my part. I didn't say anything, I just moved really fast and he snapped at me. I should have known because at that point I was aware of how scared he gets. Because usually, I'll tell him drop it and I can grab what he's got. 

He's not protective of the kennel. I can reach in there just fine. I can reach in there when he's in there. I try not to reach around him when he's eating. I feel like he gets really uptight when he eats. I can move the bowl slowly, though. So I don't know if the food aggression is linked to the kennel thing. I don't know if the abuse is just that deeply rooted. My boyfriend and I have been playing around with different ideas. Like putting a blanket of the kennel when he's in trouble? Or leaving the kennel shut until we need to let him in there. I don't know. 

What I do know is that if something works, he'll pick it up. He's seriously the smartest thing. I just don't understand why he still gets scared and why he flinches. He's been with us for three years, now, and we've never hit him. I don't know why he's so scared. I'm really looking for ways to kind of correct this behavior so he can know better when he's in trouble.

When I moved out of my mom's house, I didn't take him with me because my mom's house had a large yard and I was moving into an apartment, so I didn't think it would be fair to him.  Almost 2 years ago, my mom's house burned down, and my husband and I had recently gotten an apartment with a yard so I took him in.  When my mom's house was rebuilt, the fenced off yard was significantly smaller.  My mom already has 2 dogs, and she is not the best dog owner.  She doesn't train them or even correct their bad behavior, and she rarely lets them out of her room.  2 months ago, I had to ask my mom to watch Blu for a couple weeks while we were living with a friend and waiting to move in to a house.  The yard at our house is large and would be perfect for Blu, but there are neighborhood deer that frequently come around, and Blu has a past of chasing wildlife (chickens, guineas, and peacocks that are no longer around at my mom's).  The yard is fenced in, but I wouldn't put it past him to jump right over it if he wanted to.  I haven't brought him to our house yet, because I'm worried he'll chase the deer, but leaving him with my mom with so little space makes me feel immense guilt.  He is getting older, and I want him to spend his last years with as much room to play as we can give him, but I'm so worried about what would happen if he attacked a deer.  This has caused a few small arguments between my husband and I because he thinks its a bad idea to bring Blu around the deer, and while I agree it could be a problem, I feel like I'm abandoning my dog.

For a long time there were disagreements about the dog, as I've been unsure how the Shepherd will go with another dog. As well as the fact Nan wanted large dogs which would be hard for her to walk. 

So anyway, Nan has impulsively bought an 8 week old poodle cross dog. A toy breed. (At least it's small!)

1667958817,self.DogAdvice,True,"We adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues

I'm deciding to post here because I can't find a lot of information online for our particular situation.

My boyfriend and I just bought our first house and he brought his 10 year old American Eskimo dog Jack. I've always wanted a dog and I advocate for adoption from shelters. I've always said I'd get the oldest dog at the pound. Well at the shelter, the longest resident(s) were two, a bonded pair. So that's what we got, now we have 3 dogs. The pair are almost 4 years old, siblings, shepherd/boxer mixed with some other breeds. Brother and sister, named them Dipper and Mabel.

Mabel is very shy and timid, and the shelter workers called Dipper her protector. Dipper is much more outgoing.

Well, Mabel has clamped onto Jack's head 3 times within the past month that we've all lived here. The first time, I was giving Jack a treat in front of the pair and I think she got jealous idk. This was the bite that lasted the longest (7 seconds or so). 

Please note she always bites his head and never breaks skin.

The second bite was when there was a visiting dog in the neighbors yard and our 3 dogs got excited. Maybe Dipper and Mabel, or just Mabel was scared. Jack was barking at the neighbor dog and then Mabel clamped onto his head and shook him. 

The third time was just now, when we were all in the bedroom, on the bed except for Jack. All of us were playing together and having fun, but Jack was just on the floor watching. After we (thought) we all calmed down, my boyfriend went to bring Jack up onto the bed with us (he isn't usually on the bed because it's too high a jump) Mabel went to bite him again, we think she missed because we reacted so quickly. But Jack still yelped for being scared, maybe she got his fur, or maybe she did bite him. Either way, this bite lasted the least amount of time.

After doing some research I think they have littermate syndrome and Mabel got the short end of the stick. 

Looking for training advice or behavioral insights, obviously it's too late to prevent littermate syndrome. 

They are bonded and stop eating when they are separated, so getting rid of one of them is out of the question.

Also worth noting, after my boyfriend got Mabel off Jack the first time, I went to pick up Jack and then Dipper bit me on the back and tugged on me, not breaking skin but still left a big bruise. This was within the first week of adoption and honestly not worried about Dipper's aggression as it was only one instance provoked by Mabel getting yelled at and pried off, and he just wanted to do something to help her. If someone thinks this is something to worry about, please let me know but I'm more focused on Mabel's aggression.

We think the 2nd two instances were her trying to play with Jack but really not sure. Jack does not want to play.",DogAdvice,"we adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues",

My specific facility focuses more on hygiene and cleanliness as opposed to interacting and getting to know some of these dogs, which means that the dogs are supervised but we rarely touch or interact with them.

We have an approximately 2 year old mixed breed rescue dog. I suspect she has Pitbull, whippet and possibly Blue Heeler in her make up. Could be from a litter of hunting dogs.

She is a real handful and we have had a hard time getting her into a good place but the effort is paying off. Her obedience swings between Crufts level amazing and f... you depending on her focus. She exhibits possessiveness, dominance, stubborness, high prey drive / movement fixation and jealousy but not to an aggressive degree, we are slowly making headway stopping her jumping up on people and getting rid of a few irritating behaviors. 

I've had a few dogs and have a reasonable understanding of training and dog behavior but this wee bugger is the hardest dog I have ever had to train. Very smart, very stubborn.

This post is a cry for help to stop her trying to bite our feet when we walk and also to find out why she will growl and guard our feet if we or someone else touches them. She will display this behavior if we ask a stranger to touch their own feet... It's got me flummoxed.

I can only think that she may be possessive of them because they are at ground level, it's really weird behavior.

1667946208,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hello!

My partner and I are adopting a dog through a rescue program that rehomes stray dogs. So far, all things considered, he has been very well behaved - gentle spirit, no accidents in the house, learning basic commands quickly, fine with crates, and good around cats, children, and other dogs. 

We understand that as he adapts to his new environment, these things may change, but the one behavior we want to especially address is his obsession with food. Naturally, being a former stray, he’s not used to receiving meals regularly. His excitement over food has grown, to the point where he is beginning to jump onto furniture in the hopes of reaching more food, especially the cat’s.

When eating, he is ok with people petting him and moving his bowl, and growls a little when bones are taken away. No biting or aggressive behavior, but we also want to make sure he doesn’t develop that either in his obsession.

Some suggestions from trainers we have been given include investing in pet-safety cupboard locks and rewarding him with food/treats when his energy has simmered down and he’s no longer hyper focused on getting food. Curious what people’s success stories are and what other tips you may have?

1667945503,self.DogAdvice,True,"When I adopted my golden retriever, she was a few days shy of 8 weeks old. I got her from a breeder that breeds for hunting and they seemed to check all the ""ethical breeder"" boxes. 


However, the last time I adopted a puppy- it was from a backyard breeder (before I knew better) and she had no medical records, I didn't know how old she was supposed to be and we just fed her what the bag told us to before ultimately free feeding. 




So, I don't really know exactly what's right here. The hunting breeder instructed us to feed the pup only *twice* a day and .25 to .5 cup of dog food each time. She said we could use the kibble for training treats as well. I thought this was odd, since she's a bigger breed and I figured puppies eat more frequently.. she explained that they don't want their dogs ""growing too fast"" because of their growth plates which made sense to someone who knows very little about this stuff. 


Here's my concerns:

1. She is much smaller than I expected. I googled what they were suppose to look like and she seems younger. Her records say ""5lbs"" and I know her mother is a bit on the smaller side. 5lbs is supposedly the minimum weight for this age... but her face looks so much younger..like still that squished up newborn look? 


2. She is *so* hungry. I will feed her 1/3 cup at 8AM, maybe a little less for training treats, then 1/3 at 5PM.  Today, it sounded like her tummy was grumbling and she puked in her mouth a little.  Which sounds like hungry pukes (my bichon got like this when she refused to eat certain foods). 


I know some dogs are just highly good motivated and always ""hungry"", that they'll engorge themselves until they're sick. I also read that a sign of over feeding is diarrhea, which she had a couple of times when I gave her a little more food but I just brought her home on Friday so I can tell if it's just stress shits..

The first night she slept well, shit well, ate well. She just seemed to feel at home and is already pretty comfortable. 


Should I be feeding her at this frequency? I'm feeding her the same dog food the breeder used.

Linked is some pics of her so maybe you can tell me if she seems big enough to be 2 months old..Google can be deceitful sometimes.

Was watching some videos about leash walking and it made me wonder if I messed things up at the beginning of working with my puppy (he's almost 2 now) and I'm curious if I'd have luck in trying to ""re-train"" leash walking.

To preface - he doesn't pull on the leash at all but he stops and smells every. single. tree/hydrant/fence. and that gets really old, really fast.  He never pulled on the leash when he was a puppy so I never felt the need to work strongly on leash walking skills and I had read how much it wears puppies out mentally to sniff everything so I generally let him do it.  He wasn't leash reactive in the slightest, wasn't pulling like crazy, and he got to sniff and wear himself out.  Win/win/win...or so I thought.

I'm curious though if that taught him that walks are for ""sniffs"" and not actually getting anywhere. (I know he doesn't care about that but I do.) He doesn't pay much attention to me while walking and I have to pull him along every few feet to get off a scent.  I've started on a ""walk"" command (just what I call it) to have him move off a scent and carry on with our walk but that lasts for about 20 seconds before he's right back to sniffing.

I have all the time in the world to train so I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty and knowing this might take a while but I'm a little lost.  I think what sparked it was the leash training videos I was watching showed the dog paying close attention to the handler and that couldn't be further from the truth with my guy.  He's so engrossed in every single smell that he drowns out any commands and shows stubbornness.

Thanks for any help or advice.

She’s very high energy, and one night, out of nowhere, while I was shining a laser pointer for her to chase, she became obsessed with shadows.  They’re primarily moving shadows, nothing static, but it really came out of nowhere.  Since she was a little-er guy, she would yell at shadows maybe once a week while taking her out at night.  She was more afraid of the shadows previously, but is now extremely excited by them, wagging her tail profusely the entire time.  

She also licks walls in what seems to be an attempt to get at the shadows.  I’m not an expert with animals at all, but she seems to be producing an insane amount of saliva during this process: she was trying to drag away a pillow that was under my head for less than a minute and left two very large wet spots on the pillow.  There weren’t any water bottles, pipe leaks, or anything else that would’ve caused the spots

1667853337,self.DogAdvice,True,"The actual questions are at the bottom. The rest of this is just me explaining why I think my dog might need a muzzle for walks. This is very long, sorry! 

My dog, Charlie, is pretty reactionary. He loves visiting people, but he's skittish around other dogs. But, needs to get more energy out. Our backyard is fine, but he needs more. Luckily, we live in a very good neighborhood for walking! There's a lot of trees that give shade, the neighbors are typically dog friendly, and there's a park really close by! Two main problems, though: People don't leash their dogs and there's a colony of feral cats. 

There's a lot of factors that go into the first problem, and I can explain if needed, but I'd like to keep this concise. On top of that, dogs can easily break out of the fences, b/c this neighborhood is kind of old and the fences have fallen into disrepair.

Also, there's just a lot of feral cats in this neighborhood. My neighbor's backyard is very overgrown because he doesn't actually live in that house. The tall grass and overgrown bushes are the perfect place for cats to hunt for mice and other small prey. So, they're near our house a lot. Charlie has a prey drive. I absolutely do not want Charlie to catch a cat. But they kind of just roam the neighborhood, and it can be hard to avoid them. Charlie is about 70 to 75 lbs (32 kg to 34 kg) and can overpower me if he really wants to. He hasn't yet, but I know he can. 

Now, the obvious solutions to not being able to walk the neighborhood are dog parks and dog daycares. Charlie doesn't do well at the dog park. It stresses him out &amp; ppl don't always watch their dogs. We usually take the dogs to dog daycare, but it's getting really expensive and we can't afford it. We also have another dog that he can play with, but sometimes he can get stressed out when playing and he starts getting more aggressive. We know how to take care of this, as do the employees at the daycare, but not everyone does and we don't want to just entrust our dog to someone who may not be prepared. So, looking for a cheaper daycare isn't really an option. 

All of this said, I feel like a muzzle would be the easiest thing to do to protect him and others. I haven't talked to my family about this yet, because I'm afraid they'd be all ""muzzle bad!!"" and I want to have some information to give them about why muzzles are not always bad. 

I've done a little bit of research, but I have some questions: Metal/wire basket muzzles are recommended for biting dogs. My dog is not a determined biter. He nips at people who come towards him, but can be more harsh to dogs that come near him. Still not a full-on bite, more of a snap, but do I need a metal/wire muzzle anyway? Since he might chase the cats, should I get a metal muzzle no matter what? Biothane muzzles look a lot more comfortable and friendly, and are advertised to hold up against dogs that nip &amp; snap, but how ""big"" is a nip? Biothane muzzles are also more expensive. Are there any brands you guys would recommend? Preferably cheaper but I'll always take quality over price. As of right now, I'm leaning towards a biothane muzzle, but I want to know more from other dog owners.

1667852755,self.DogAdvice,True,"We rehomed a female miniature poodle at 4 months old. By the time we got her, we were already her 4th house - she was passed from family to family who couldn't properly care for her. We also have a spayed adult yorkie mix with whom she gets along great. Puppy is scheduled to be spayed in a couple of weeks.

Puppy has been having intermittent bathroom issues. My husband works from home every weekday, I am on a hybrid schedule. On the days that I'm not home, he was finding one or two mistakes on the carpet in the living room despite letting her out every 2 hours. To remedy this, we cut off her access to the rest of the house when we work. We each have our offices gated off in a way that allows our yorkie to hop the fence and do as she pleases while the puppy is stuck with one of us unless she asks to leave (at which point we take her outside to pee and give her a chance to get a drink). She was also having issues peeing the bed overnight. We started crating her (much to her dismay) and given our different sleep schedules, she was going about 7.5 hours in her crate without having to pee. We started letting her sleep in the bed with us again and she hasn't had any other issues peeing the bed overnight. We have left the crate set up at the foot of the bed in case we need to go back to using it.

However, today we had a really weird issue. I was cleaning up during my lunch and left the bedroom door open as I toted some laundry out.  I noticed her go trotting into our bedroom. We have a dog bed on top of the crate because the cats like to perch up there. She jumped up into the bed on the crate and started peeing. I hurried over there and picked her up, which caused her to pause, and I went out on the patio with her and kept telling her to ""go potty"" to which she correctly walked o
into the grass and finished. She had been let out an hour and half earlier

Keep in mind, I don't raise my voice at the dogs - the most they've ever gotten is a low pitched ""NO"" if they're trying to eat rabbit poop in the backyard. I didnt even say the word NO when I caught her peeing in the dog bed because I was afraid it might cause her to associate peeing in general as negative. However, this poor dog was clearly upset after coming back in the house even after receiving a treat for finishing her business correctly. She went so far as to go and sulk on the couch in the other room, which is what she does when we've finished something she doesn't enjoy, like getting a bath or cleaning her ears - she didn't even want to follow me back into my office but I managed to coax her in here where she is now curled up and taking a nap.

We've never had issues like this with our other dog, so we're trying to navigate this as properly as possible. I know she's only 7 months old, so I'm not overly concerned about the occasional mistake on a rug - we've come up with ways to circumvent that problem. I'm mainly concerned about her reactions to being redirected away from the things she's doing wrong. Not to anthropomorphize her, but it's like she's super sensitive and gets her feelings hurt if you try to redirect her incorrect behavior. Am I doing something wrong? I'm going to take her to the vet to check for a UTI just in case, but she isn't showing any signs of one besides the accidents.

So as the title says I am ready at last to get my own standard poodle. My favorite breed of dogs. My sister has a small one but she is not a good source of information.

Just to get it out of the way - I know that owning a dog is costly and I work from home. I chose the standard breed as I am rather active for longer walks and prefer the bigger size dog.

Few questions.

I am looking for an 8 weeks old puppy and I know that first half the year we need to be together all the time. But will I be able to live him home alone at 8 months as I usually spend weekend riding my motorcycle?

We live in a two story apartment - is it ok if the puppy sleeps on the first floor from the beginning as the cabinet is the most comfy and warm room?

My workplace has pet insurance for funny money - like $ 10 a month. Does it worth it?

Do you have experience in leaving the dog in daycare for a few days. I googled and there a re plenty with $65 a day separate room.

We also have a parrot. He is mature smart and coward. Usually he is pretty quiet, but when he is worried - as he sees a new face he may scream a few times. And this is not a good experience. Will it be very detrimental for a pup?

How easy(or hard) is keep a male poodle without neutering him? Do I get him a doll or there is like a circle of owners that let their pets copulate?

Also, what is ""a must"" when I purchase a pup? Some of them are reputable breeders and want $ 3000 for a pup with a waiting list about a year. Others are twice less than that and available but is it OK if they are not AKC registered? Also, I am definitely not going to participate in shows or making money out of puppies.

Something to note is our setup: both my husband and I work out of the house all day. We have another dog as well. They both have access to the dog door (fenced-in backyard) so they can come and go as they please while we're away.

I think my best option is longer walks and also walking him in the morning, but I'm not sure if that will help, or how long a walk needs to be to really keep him interested and tired out.

Three months ago we got a doberman pup, it's our second doberman after our previous one crossed the bridge to dog heaven due to old age, a year ago.

We try as much as possible to not leave him alone at home as we already know from experience these dogs are clingy to their owners and are prone to seperation anxiety.  
Sadly, things don't always work out, and from time to time he has to spend some alone time at home. Of course he always has access to food, water, toys and sometimes even a bone to keep him busy.   
The issue is, that when left alone he becomes a different dog, and I don't think I have to be a dog psychiatrist to determine it is seperation anxiety.   


He immideatly starts.. screaming? I don't think barking or whining with any adjective would describe what that is. He doesn't destroy anything, and most of the time he won't even pee or poop  on the floor. He just stands at the door, for an hour or more, barking and whining like crazy. I can hear it from a block away, it's non stop. I'm not sure he even breathes while at it.  
Luckily for us we live in a dog friendly country, else the neighbours would sue us already and honeslty I can't blame them.

We’ll put dogs in the cage when Giz comes over so she can get acclimated to the environment. But when john sees her, he’ll just bark his brains out scaring giz into a retreat making it hard for her to want to explore ): The only XP Giz has with dogs is just the very infrequent few day intervals with extreme supervision.

I can’t put her in my room because at around 5 am every morning she begins to whine.

1667793891,self.DogAdvice,True,"Dudes... I have no idea what I'm doing. My 2 yr old Bichon Frise has not been socialized and we just never thought we would get another dog. We are her entire world. But since I've been able to stay home and pull my head out my ass, I noticed that she actually might need a sibling. 


So I agreed with my husband's wish to get a golden retriever. We figured the energy level would be great match. 

We've googled and YouTube how to raise this new pup, wanting to avoid the mistakes made with our Bichon. But what we didn't consider, stupidly and ironically, was how to help them get along. 


1. We thought she was going to be bigger..and totally forgot what an infant pup with pirahana teeth was like

2. Although we were so ignorant and made many mistakes with Bichon, it was easier to just focus on her. Training a new pup and showering her with do much attention, with a dog that has been spoiled all her life is a challenge I just didn't anticipate. 


Our Bichon might pull on the leash and doesn't know any traditional commands but she is actually a very polite and sweet girl. 



We were warned by the breeder that this Golden pup was ""anti-social"" as compared to her more social butterfly sister. Breeder seemed nervous about our Bichon getting along with her but Golden came right to us, fell asleep in our arms, and seemed to be indifferent about Bichon.


This will be our 2nd night with the new babe. I know she's only an infant and has only been with us for 48 hours. But my Bichon seems to be going through a mix of emotions and I have little idea of how go help transition together.


Golden wants to cuddle with us, naturally. Bichon is keeping her distance because Golden has asked for space... So Bichon doesn't get to cuddle or be close with us. 

It seems like Bichon is mostly curious, sometimes tries to ""correct"" Golden with boops or light display of dominance and Golden will lie down/show belly. But for the most part she stares from a distances, takes the opportunity to sniff the baby when she is sleeping, and is *incredibly* tolerant when Golden nips her. 

I mean, she's latched onto her lip with them shark teeth and my a Bichon just stood still, she never reacts even when her tail is being bitten. This hasn't happened often, we try to keep them separate and make them respect space if they are rowdy. 


Invitation to play turns into annoyance or fear because it seems Bichon is unsure how to play with this baby.. and Golden nips or gets irritated with the darting around. 


It honestly makes me sad that it appears my Bichon is trying to figure out this new friend, wants to play but doesn't know how, and is also dealing with her home and family being taken over. 

I feel like an utter failure. I'm heart broken over how poorly my beloved 2 yr old has been socialized and seems to want a friend so badly. And I'm frustrated that I can watch all the videos on dog body language but it seems like it all goes through one ear and out the other, not to mention with all the different methods and opinions and advise that seems to conflict. 

I'm worried they may never get along, because these first few weeks/month are so important and that I'm fucking it up by either intervening with the way they figure things out or allowing bad habits. 


So far they eat well together, sometimes sleep near each other.. but mostly keep a distance. 

I will be crate training Golden as advised by the breeder. I'm hoping to also work on training my Bichon. 

Any advice about how to facilitate their relationship is much appreciated. I genuinely wanted a sibling for my Bichon, not to just get another dog. 

I'm also considering getting a trainer for them both? I don't know how young is too young for that but I feel like I need the help...

1667793097,self.DogAdvice,True,"OK so I've got a Pitbull-Terrier/German Sheppard Mix who's a little over one year old. We got her at 4 months old. I'm a truck driver, so she went on the road with me for about 4 months while I worked on training her, getting to know her, and bonding with her.

Originally we thought the fear was just because of a new environment, so we did as we were advised by vet and trainer, and gave it time, hoping she'd adjust. After 4 months of her ultimately shutting down while I drove and opening up, getting playful and happy when I parked, we realized it wasn't a ""new environment"", but instead a fear of a vehicle in motion. Stop lights, stop signs, parked, as long as it's not moving she is 100% open and happy. So sadly I pulled her off the truck and she's become my wife's dog. Except when the wife comes out with me once a year.

Just got done with the wife being out with me for 2 weeks and Snowball has acted a lot more comfortable this time due to the wife being on the truck. Vet has made a few suggestions about it maybe being motion sickness, so we tried motion sickness medications (no effect), tried a thunder wrap jacket which makes her feel like she's being hugged all the time which has helped quite a bit, but not solved the issue. We also set her crate up which is what she feels is her safe space, which is frankly where she spent most of her time while we were moving.

I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and if there is anything we can do to make her more comfortable during the occasion ride? Obviously I'll never be able to bring her back on the truck full time, I wouldn't dream of it considering her obvious fear of riding, but it would be nice if she wasn't so scared when going to the vet, to the park, to the pet store, etc etc.

Recently read CBD might help. We know she deals with SEVERE separation anxiety (this was from before we got her, but being with me on the truck 24/7 probably didn't help that issue), but don't know if that's related to the fear of the vehicles moving.

If anyone has any suggestions it would be extremely helpful. Thank you!",DogAdvice,"Dog scared of car while in motion, but is fine with the car as long as it's stopped.",

1667781541,self.DogAdvice,True,"Yesterday, I adopted a sheltie gsd mix from my cousin, who's roommate had puppies and needed to rehome them. They had their first few vaccines and a dewormer. This is relevant later in my post. Yesterday, when the puppy came home, he met my 4 y/o male GSD outside in our backyard. I recognize this may not be the best way to introduce them, but I do not have the possibility to introduce them another way. At first, he was just very curious of the puppy and was sniffing him a lot, and the puppy was laying on his back very submissively while my older dog examined him. Then, once the puppy started to move, my GSD tried to grab him and the puppy yelped. When this happened, my GSD went into what I call ""lock mode"" and he tried to go after my puppy. I picked him up and walked away, and my family members helped by taking my GSD inside and I put my puppy in the crate I set up for him. It is near our living room and dining room. My GSD was highly anxious, panting a lot and just standing outside of his crate. He would occasionally bark playfully at my puppy, but once or twice it was a firm and unhappy bark. My puppy seemed really scared, and once we took out my GSD I took out the puppy from his crate. He projectile diarrhea all over the living room, I'm guessing from stress or fear. Once he was cleaned and settled he was calm, but he started having bad diarrhea for the rest of the evening and today as well. I would take him in front by himself on a loose leash and he would poop, he is a very smart puppy and is already house trained in just one day. Today his diarrhea was basically water, and I called so many vets and animal hospitals, but none were open since its Sunday. I was fearing he maybe had Parvo or Giardia.  I took him to my dad's camper on his truck since it was a nice breezy day and we didn't want to risk my other dog getting sick. I set up his kennel in there and he seemed to like that environment much more. He ate rice, boiled chicken and carrots to soothe his stomach and he drank lots of water, and was so relaxed he even took a nice nap, which he hadn't been able to do since yesterday. He was very playful with me and was cuddly as well. I spoke to my cousin and he agreed to take him for the rest of the day to see if the better environment, or one that he was used to, would help his symptoms. Once we arrived at his house, he was very happy to see his dad and he immediately went to play with him, and then went to lay down on his belly on the kitchen tiles, very relaxed. Then he went into his kennel where I left him, and he was eating more of the mix I packed for him. Now I am wondering if the issue was my GSD, since he was so vigilant about him and would not let him rest. Every time he would move, my GSD would come running up to the crate and watched his every move. I am scared that maybe I am not the right home for him. I understand it takes hard work to raise a puppy and I am ready for that, but I also do not want to risk my GSD hurting my puppy intentionally or by accident. I also do not want the puppy to suffer from extreme stress and fear, when he could be in another calmer environment. He is such a sweet and gentle puppy that I want the best for him, but I have also grown so attached to him already and he has with me as well. I am very conflicted and don't know what to do. Puppy has a vet appointment tomorrow to rule out any viral or bacterial infections.

My dog (I’m going to call him T) is 3 y/o, he is kinda large (25 kilos), VERY strong and incredibly rough in the way he plays. He never hurt anyone, what I mean is: he doesn’t realise how big he is in comparison to others so he plays as if everyone is his size

What happened today: I was on my way to the park with T and my 11 y/o cousin and she wanted to walk him and take the leash. Out of nowhere, T starts pulling really hard bc he saw a another dog, but it was so rough that my cousin almost fell to the ground and he went straight to the other dog. It took me a solid 2 seconds to realise what was happening and grab him by the harness. 

Honestly, idk if T was trying to play, but thankfully the other dog took it like a champ. Understandably, the owner was livid and started yelling at me but I was so shocked that I don’t even know if I apologised. 

Like an idiot I still took him to the park (6 blocks away) and on the way he wanted to greet a random woman so I got furious and grabbed him by the harness, again, but this time all the way to the park.

When I got to the park I went to the place all the dogs are and T was playing like usual but when he got tired and was laying next to us. A puppy came and started being cute and giving us kisses. I thought it was weird that T didn’t react at all cause normally he just looks at me and jumps to get my attention, but I though nothing of it (again, stupid). After the fourth time the puppy came, he accidentally stepped on T’s ball and T went crazy, started growling and tried to stand up. I grabbed him so nothing happened but I got furious. When I was scolding him the puppy’s owners were apologising profusely and I was apologising to them, too.

It’s a minimum 8% crude fat. I was told to look for MAX 8% in the past but the minimum is fine.

However, my dog isn’t getting fat, he isn’t gaining weight, he has normal poops and is a happy 5 year old. I would really like to switch him to a better, richer kibble that he deserves without crazy toppers like chicken or goat milk!

I’ve been looking at grain-inclusive options between open farm, orijen or jignature. Although the lowest crude fat minimum is 15%.

Has anyone’s vet ever told them something similar? I fear that this is advice he once gave me based off assumption and the last thing I want is to harm my boys tummy? What do you think?

1667734188,self.DogAdvice,True,"When we got our 2 year old Bichon, we had no idea what we were doing and were afraid of noise violation when crate training so we just didn't crate train her. We like sleeping with her and so that's been our dynamic. 

However, we picked up an 8 week old Golden Retriever yesterday and we are wiser now, having learned from our mistakes with our first pup. We *do* plan to crate train her and more or less know how but there are different opinions about crating the first handful of nights at this age.

This is important to me and from her perspective, she's just been taken from mama and littermates. So  I'm posting at 4 AM, having had maybe 2 hours of sleep total, wondering when I can start fucking crating her lol

Some articles say I can expedite her sleeping through the night by crating. I'm just worried that she'll associate it with being isolated and scared. I want this crate training to go as smoothly as possible. Of course I'll train throughout the day too. 

Each time she's gotten rowdy or whined, I took her out of our bed to go potty and she's peed. She'll come back to bed, play a little, then sleep. So it's not to crazy. I'm just looking at... what? 8 more weeks of sleep deprivation? 

Is it normal for me to just lose sleep until she is fully potty trained and sleeping in her crate? I guess it wouldn't be the first time I went insomniac for several weeks lol. 

Am I wrong to let her sleep with us for a while? If it helps build security and confidence.. how soon do you think I should start trying to crate her at night?

1667708812,self.DogAdvice,True,"A year ago, my family adopted a 5.5 y/o supposed Pomeranian/Lhasa Apso from the local shelter. We neutered him, got him groomed, and fixed his ear infection. We were told he had a bite history but it was implied it was one time &amp; was regarding touching his sensitive infected ears.

He is cured to my knowledge from the infection. He is VERY cuddly and loves attention. He’s overall a sweetheart! But sometimes he can have triggers that turns him into a “Mr. Hyde”, and it does not appear to be a fear response. I’m talking when he doesn’t want to get off the couch, leave the car he hopped into unexpectedly, have his toy he suddenly decided to protect be approached, or be prevented from eating poop (cat, dog, doesn’t matter). 

A trainer we saw with him suggested a drag leash to be able to pull him away from his trigger which helped a lot towards protecting everyone involved. He immediately acts like nothing happened! However… he’s banned from the groomers, at least for nail trimming I think, because he’s bitten the groomers too many times. One groomer was bitten during the cutting process &amp; she finished the next day, the next groomer was bitten while trimming the nails to the point she had to leave and seek care.

Putting it in his food is not a viable option for regular consumption. Need creative ideas to coax/trick him into eating it (it can be crushed into a powder). Peanut butter and cheese don’t work. :(

I need some very creative suggestions here. My 9 year old Bichon was prescribed a joint supplement to be on for the rest of his life, but I cannot for the life of me get him to regularly consume it. Our journey so far: day one, he ate it on its own after I cut it into small pieces fairly happily. Day two, he refused to do this so I wrapped the small pieces in some cheese and this worked for another 2-3 days. Then he began to somehow eat just the cheese around it (all while keeping it inside his mouth) and then spit out the joint supplement piece inside. Okay, fine. I started to crush it into a powder and put it in his breakfast since he gets wet food with each meal, and this worked fine for a bit until he decided to go on a few day fast (which is not atypical for him, so please disregard this fact. He is otherwise healthy and always eats normally within 3-4 days). New plan was to crush it into the powder and put it into peanut butter so he couldn’t physically eat any part of it without consuming the supplement. I implemented the plan this morning, and I kid you not, my dog who loves peanut butter did not touch it. I am at my wits end, and short of forcing him to eat it like a pill (which I REALLY don’t want to do), I am out of ideas.

She won’t eat her food all day then down it right before bedtime so she usually has to go bathroom in the middle of the night. I’m worried if I put her food/water up at a certain time she’ll go the whole day without eating? 

She hasn’t been listening to her usual commands at all (go outside, out of the kitchen, gentle, even just “no”, etc.) and just ignoring us in general. She’s also been sniffing on top of tables/counters and even sniffing plates- all of the above she knows not to do and never did before. 

The two biggest changes that I think could be triggering all of this: back in June we had one of our other dogs put down, they were quite close. The other thing is that I’m currently 8 months pregnant, so maybe she can sense the change coming?

We were walking (she's on a lead), we ran into another dog that we see every now and then, on a lead with her owner as well, and as my dog loves all other dogs, she wanted to say hello, and so did the other dog.

I am at my wits end here, we don’t sleep because we are constantly up cleaning. I’ve taken him to the vet, $400 later and he’s fine. I don’t know what else to do, what else to try.

1667614104,self.DogAdvice,True,"Hey ya'll firstly I'm a new dog owner and have been learning a lot, but recently my dog bolted off and it was a frightening situation so I'm wondering how to go able handling it.

For some context, and yes this will make me seem very irresponsible but like I said I'm new to all of this and still learning the boundaries and relationship you have with dogs, so I did make a mistake and hopefully have been able to properly identify where I went wrong to learn.

So I got my Amstafg from a shelter July, 5 years old yet he's very sweet and affectionate, very obedient and responsive when at home. I've asked before here about leash training and will be working on that soon, but to re-explain here, he gets very excited and pulls hard on the leash. The shelter gave me a muzzle halti but it feels awful and he hates it so I've just got a harness and been slowly working with him, more just trying to get him out and get used to the area rather than training him.

Anyway, the otherday I left the front door open to take out trash, now he is such a good boy with 0 training he doesnt run away even as I left him at the open front door and went to the back of the house (please let me know if this is bad for whatever reason, I just trusted him) and he even came out and hung around me out the front, slowly beginning to walk off but once he left my ""orbit"" I said No and called him back, he would come sit next to me and I gave him some pets and praised him.

Now in hindsight I realise he was starting to get more and more excited the more he did it, only about 3 times, then I took the bin around the corner and he sniffed around a bit, as I turn around to call him back he just bolted.

He wouldn't listen to anything I would say or respond at all, only running further and faster away the closer I got. Eventually I got him back.

I don't blame him I'm sure from his perspective he thinks he did nothing wrong and just got to run around for a bit, I realise I should have noticed his excitement and praised him for the good behaviour and then put him inside to calm down. 

I'm wondering to anyone who is willing to offer advice, is there anyway to train this behaviour? Or is he just too excitable outside to be left unleashed? What might have been his reasoning or his behaviour or thought process to make him bolt and stop listening? 

I dont understand dog behaviour all that well yet, so I just assume he was too hyped and excited to properly understand or register my commands?",DogAdvice,Amstaff bolting off and unresponsive,

1667601920,self.DogAdvice,True,"Disclaimer: this is just an opinion, singular POV, everyone has different experiences with raising dogs and use of hyperbolic language is used to highlight a particular point. So let's be nice to each other.

Whenever someone has a particular fear or intense dislike of a certain breed of dog I always think it's because they struggle to pick up on other people's emotions when they're looking at that person's face.

For example, when a scary looking man shows no emotion on their face while making direct eye contact with you it's very unsettling. Imagine not being able to look at a dog and figure out how that dog is feeling in that moment. You wouldn't be able to effectively raise that dog without being able to pick up on it's emotional energy so you can steer the dog towards the correct behaviour. 

When young and learning your mind is very plastic. Puppy's seem to have a way they go through life in those early stages. Which is made easier to keep the puppy calm when you know how to react to it's actions. When a 15kg ball of cunt comes bundling at you, barking and growling like something kicked it in the nut sack, shaking like a cat shitting razorblades. And you panic, then you're only going to make the fucker freak out more by acting like an absolute twat and screaming your head off. You'll be raising a toddler killing machine by the time of it's 4th year or worse getting your face eaten while you're sleeping.

Just get a toy breed instead as you're clearly looking for a baby to keep basically from cradle to grave. Log on to the KC, check the inbreeding coefficient percentages of ancestral lines for 8 generations of Cavapoo and make sure that puppy doesn't have any illnesseses or genetic disorders that cripple the fucker all 7 long years of its aching life.

Or better yet, grab a mutt thats been moved 7 times in 1.5 years that desperately wants to maul another child due to its terrier traits.

Fucking waste of time. People make bad mistakes all the time. People get hurt in all sorts of ways because of our mistakes. Just stop fighting with each other about how to properly stop this issue. Whether it be kill all of them and make some dumpster meat or it's all love #nobaddogonlybadowners both camps make me sick.

There's a wealth of knowledge out there about how to raise great dogs of all breeds, whether you want smashed and slammed or pure bred crufts champion. It's easy to understand what each dog breed requires to not grow up a dick so it lives a long and healthy life.

Stop pretending you know more than others because you watched 75 hours of Yankies breeding the love out of GSDs through ""what to do to raise a great German Shepherd and why they're the perfect canine companions"".

1667599165,self.DogAdvice,True,"I live in a block of flats, with narrow hallways on each floor, which connect lifts, the stairwell and the doors of the individual units. My neighbour has 2 chihuahuas and her door is just next to the lifts, so I need to wait there for the lifts and get off there when exiting the lifts. One of her dogs bit me two times. 

First, she opened the door and the dog immediately ran out and bit the back of my leg, in less than 2 seconds, as I was waiting less then 2 meters from her door for the lift (the lifts are exactly near her door). She did not apologise, but asked me if the dog did me any damage and then just took the dog back in an slammed the door. Second time, her dog ran into the lift when I was returning home, and in less the 2 seconds bit my shoe. She was in her flat, but left the door open for some reason and the dogs were on the hallway. She also opens the door, and lets the dogs out on the hallway while they wear extensible leads, and they act aggressively towards me when i exit the lift and then get in the lift WHILE WEARING LEADS (so they might get strangled if someone calls the lift).

I tried to talk to her, but was impossible. She yelled that her dogs never bite, and when they bite it doesn’t matter as they are smaller then cats (yes, great logic). The she proceeded to yell “do you want me to sacrifice them? Do you want to go to the police?” with her kids present, while I told her that I just wanted the dogs to wear leads and not be unsupervised, as bites can get infected. So talking to the woman is out of the question, and I am trying to reason with the dogs instead.

I had 3 dogs as a kid (ex-stray dogs in the countryside so very different setup) and never seen this behaviour. My guess is that the chihuahua that bit me is super territorial and thinks the hallway is his home too, and is probably scared when seeing strangers. So far I tried talking to it calmly, calling it cutes names, and pushing him away with my bag when it tries to jump at my ankles. But this is getting ridiculous. I started having my phone ready to record and further interactions, as the owner of f the dogs calls me a liar even if she saw the first bite. I don’t want to sue or anything like that, but in this province the authorities will make the owner vaccinate the dog for rabies/do some classes if you prove they bite (rabies vaccine is not mandatory otherwise which is stupid - this is a rabies free country in Europe except few incidents). 

Any idea what I could try next? Maybe crouch and sweet talk the dogs? I want to start a family soon, and really don’t want to keep having to be on the lookout for untrained dogs every time I go in/out of my flat when pregnant or with a pram.",DogAdvice,How to deal with neighbour’s biting dogs,
1667597807,self.DogAdvice,True,"So I have a female cocker, aged 3. She was spayed later in life and has a habit of marking territory. Before anyone asks, we’ve ruled out medical issues with a vet. 

She marks multiple times during walks (the smallest amounts), marks after seeing another dog, has marked on her new beds, and if shes in someone else’s house she will try to mark indoors despite being house trained. It’s not super often that she will mark indoors, but it’s unpredictable enough to where I get nervous bringing her to someone’s house.

We don’t know yet if she will ever stop the behavior, but I don’t want this to mean she can’t come with us on adventures. And I certainly don’t want it to mean I have to board her when I want to see family out of concern for her marking habits. She’s perfect to me and holds her bladder just fine, it’s just that she marks sometimes. 

Anyway, are dog diapers a good solution to this? I would only have them on her when she is indoors at a stranger’s house. I trust she wouldn’t release a bladder’s worth of pee into it. And she would do just fine sleeping with it off. Has anyone tried this? Or is there a secret training solution I need? Because I’m open to that too, lol!

We rescued our now 6.5 year old (""D"") from a littermate syndrome home life... it was not a good one, it was to the point the siblings were fighting pretty bad and he has scars from it. But he bonded almost immediately with our now 3.5 year old (""C"") rescue we already had at home who came from a completely different bad situation (he was kept in a yard from birth - mom and siblings taken away at a younger age - and not really able to socialize beyond what he could see) thankfully our first rescue though skittish at times has taken to things SO well and we've had him for 3 + years or so now and our 6.5 year old we've had for roughly 2 years or so.

I give a little background because I was wondering if the littermate syndrome traits could continue over and that's something that needs to be worried about?
